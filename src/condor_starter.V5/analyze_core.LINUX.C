Purpose:
	Look for a "core" file at a given location.  Return TRUE if it exists
	and appears complete and correct, and FALSE otherwise.

	This code requires a *correct* libbfd, liberty, bfd.h and ansidecl.h.
	The code has been tested with libbfd.so.2.6.0.12.  Correct versions
	of the heasers and libraries should be included with this distribution.
