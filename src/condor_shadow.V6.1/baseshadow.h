	If you want to change something related to the shadow, 
	make sure you know how these classes interact.  If it's a general
	shadow thing, you very well may want to add it to this class.  
	However, if it is specific to one remote resource, you want to
	look at RemoteResource.  If it is single, MPI, or PVM (one day!)
	specific, make the change in that derived class. <p>

	More to come...<p>

	This class has some pure virtual functions, so it's an abstract
	class.  You therefore can't instantiate it; you must instantiate
	one of its dervide classes.<p>

	Based heavily on code by Todd Tannenbaum.
