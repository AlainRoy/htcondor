/** This class represents one remotely running user job.  <p>

	This class has a Socket to the remote job from which it can handle
	syscalls.  It can also talk to the startd and request to start a
	starter, and it can kill the starter as well.<p>

	For all functions that start with 'get' and are passed a char*, 
	the following applies: if a NULL value is passed in as the argument, 
	space is new'ed for you, *unless* the member you requested is NULL.  
	If it is NULL, space is not new'ed and a NULL is returned.  If the 
	parameter you pass is not NULL, it is assumed to point to valid memory, 
	and the char* will be copied in.  If the member you request is NULL, 
	the parameter you passed in will be set to "".<p>
	
    <b>Summary of get* functions:</b><p>

	Parameter  Member   Results
	---------  ------   ----------
