##  hawkeye_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for Hawkeye.
##
##  The file is divided into four main parts:
##  Part 1:  Settings you MUST customize 
##  Part 2:  Settings you may want to customize
##  Part 3:  Settings that control the policy of when hawkeye will
##           start and stop jobs on your machines
##  Part 4:  Settings you should probably leave alone (unless you
##  know what you're doing)
##
##  Please read the INSTALL file (or the Install chapter in the
##  Hawkeye Administrator's Manual) for detailed explanations of the 
##  various settings in here and possible ways to configure your
##  pool. 
##
##  If you are installing hawkeye as root and then handing over the
##  administration of this file to a person you do not trust with
##  root access, please read the Installation chapter paying careful
##  note to the hawkeye_config.root entries.
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.
##
##  Unless otherwise indicated, all settings which specify a time are
##  defined in seconds.

######################################################################

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Host/IP access levels
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Please see the administrator's manual for details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.

##  What machines have administrative rights for your pool?  This
##  defaults to your central manager.  You should set it to the
##  machine(s) where whoever is the hawkeye administrator(s) works
##  (assuming you trust all the users who log into that/those
##  machine(s), since this is machine-wide access you're granting).
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(HAWKEYE_HOST), $(FULL_HOSTNAME)

##  If there are no machines that should have administrative access 
##  to your pool (for example, there's no machine where only trusted
##  users have accounts), you can uncomment this setting.
##  Unfortunately, this will mean that administering your pool will 
##  be more difficult.
#HOSTDENY_ADMINISTRATOR = *

##  What machines should have "owner" access to your machines, meaning
##  they can issue commands that a machine owner should be able to
##  issue to their own machine (like hawkeye_vacate).  This defaults to
##  machines with administrator access, and the local machine.  This
##  is probably what you want.
HOSTALLOW_OWNER = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR)

##  Read access.  Machines listed as allow (and/or not listed as deny)
##  can view the status of your pool, but cannot join your pool 
##  or run jobs.
##  NOTE: By default, without these entries customized, you
##  are granting read access to the whole world.  You may want to
##  restrict that to hosts in your domain.  If possible, please also
##  grant read access to "*.cs.wisc.edu", so the Hawkeye developers
##  will be able to view the status of your pool and more easily help
##  you install, configure or debug your Hawkeye installation.
##  It is important to have this defined.
HOSTALLOW_READ = * 
#HOSTALLOW_READ = *.your.domain, *.cs.wisc.edu
#HOSTDENY_READ = *.bad.subnet, bad-machine.your.domain, 144.77.88.*

##  Write access.  Machines listed here can join your pool, submit
##  jobs, etc.  Note: Any machine which has WRITE access must
##  also be granted READ access.  Granting WRITE access below does
##  not also automatically grant READ access; you must change
##  HOSTALLOW_READ above as well.
##  If you leave it as it is, it will be unspecified, and effectively
##  it will be allowing anyone to write to your pool.
HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *
#HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain, your-friend's-machine.other.domain
#HOSTDENY_WRITE = bad-machine.your.domain

##  Negotiator access.  Machines listed here are trusted central
##  managers.  You should normally not have to change this.
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST)
##  Now, with flocking we need to let the SCHEDD trust the other 
##  negotiators we are flocking with as well.  You should normally 
##  not have to change this either.
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD = $(NEGOTIATOR_HOST), $(FLOCK_NEGOTIATOR_HOSTS)

##  Config access.  Machines listed here can use the hawkeye_config_val
##  tool to modify all daemon configurations except those specified in
##  the hawkeye_config.root file.  This level of host-wide access
##  should only be granted with extreme caution.  By default, config
##  access is denied from all hosts.
#HOSTALLOW_CONFIG = trusted-host.your.domain

##  Flocking Configs.  These are the real things that Hawkeye looks at,
##  but we set them from the FLOCK_FROM/TO macros above.  It is safe
##  to leave these unchanged.
HOSTALLOW_WRITE_COLLECTOR = $(HOSTALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_WRITE_STARTD    = $(HOSTALLOW_WRITE), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_READ_COLLECTOR  = $(HOSTALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)
HOSTALLOW_READ_STARTD     = $(HOSTALLOW_READ), $(FLOCK_FROM)


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Security parameters for setting configuration values remotely:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  These parameters define the list of attributes that can be set
##  remotely with hawkeye_config_val for the security access levels
##  defined above (for example, WRITE, ADMINISTRATOR, CONFIG, etc).
##  Please see the administrator's manual for futher details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.  There are no
##  default values for any of these settings.  If they are not
##  defined, no attributes can be set with hawkeye_config_val.

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "CONFIG" permission (as
##  defined with HOSTALLOW_CONFIG and HOSTDENY_CONFIG above).
##  The commented-out value here was the default behavior of Hawkeye
##  prior to version 6.3.3.  If you don't need this behavior, you
##  should leave this commented out.
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_CONFIG = *

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "ADMINISTRATOR"
##  permission (as defined above)
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_ADMINISTRATOR = *_DEBUG, MAX_*_LOG

##  Attributes that can be set by hosts with "OWNER" permission (as
##  defined above) NOTE: any Hawkeye job running on a given host will
##  have OWNER permission on that host by default.  If you grant this
##  kind of access, Hawkeye jobs will be able to modify any attributes
##  you list below on the machine where they are running.  This has
##  obvious security implications, so only grant this kind of
##  permission for custom attributes that you define for your own use
##  at your pool (custom attributes about your machines that are
##  published with the STARTD_EXPRS setting, for example).
#SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute, another_custom_attr

##  You can also define daemon-specific versions of each of these
##  settings.  For example, to define settings that can only be
##  changed in the hawkeye_startd's configuration by hosts with OWNER
##  permission, you would use:
#STARTD_SETTABLE_ATTRS_OWNER = your_custom_attribute_name

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Network filesystem parameters:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use NFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_NFS		= False

##  Do your machines run AFS?
#HAS_AFS		= False

##  Do you want to use AFS for file access instead of remote system
##  calls?
#USE_AFS		= False

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Miscellaneous:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Hawkeye needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) hawkeye is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the hawkeye_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  hawkeye account, it's probably hawkeye.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the HAWKEYE_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.
LOCK		= $(LOCAL_DIR)/log

##  If you don't use a fully qualified name in your /etc/hosts file
##  (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an alias,
##  Hawkeye wouldn't normally be able to use fully qualified names in
##  places that it'd like to.  You can set this parameter to the
##  domain you'd like appended to your hostname, if changing your host
##  information isn't a good option.  This parameter must be set in
##  the global config file (not the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE from above). 
#DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME = your.domain.name

##  Hawkeye can be told whether or not you want the Hawkeye daemons to
##  create a core file if something really bad happens.  This just
##  sets the resource limit for the size of a core file.  By default,
##  we don't do anything, and leave in place whatever limit was in
##  effect when you started the Hawkeye daemons.  If this parameter is
##  set and "True", we increase the limit to as large as it gets.  If
##  it's set to "False", we set the limit at 0 (which means that no
##  core files are even created).  Core files greatly help the Hawkeye
##  developers debug any problems you might be having.
#CREATE_CORE_FILES	= True


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Settings that control the daemon's debugging output:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAX_COLLECTOR_LOG	= 64000

MAX_STARTER_LOG		= 640000
STARTER_DEBUG		= D_NODATE

MAX_MASTER_LOG		= 64000
MASTER_DEBUG		= 
##  When the master starts up, should it truncate it's log file?
#TRUNC_MASTER_LOG_ON_OPEN        = False

##  Log files
COLLECTOR_LOG	= $(LOG)/CollectorLog
MASTER_LOG	= $(LOG)/MasterLog
STARTD_LOG	= $(LOG)/StartLog


##  In most cases, your hawkeye_collector and hawkeye_negotiator are 
##  going to run on the same machine.  If for some reason, this isn't 
##  the case, here's where you'd change it:
COLLECTOR_HOST	= $(HAWKEYE_HOST)

##  How long are you willing to let daemons try their graceful
##  shutdown methods before they do a hard shutdown? (30 minutes)
#SHUTDOWN_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT	= 1800

##  How much disk space would you like reserved from Hawkeye?  In
##  places where Hawkeye is computing the free disk space on various
##  partitions, it subtracts the amount it really finds by this
##  many megabytes.  (If undefined, defaults to 0).
RESERVED_DISK		= 5

##  If your machine is running AFS and the AFS cache lives on the same
##  partition as the other Hawkeye directories, and you want Hawkeye to
##  reserve the space that your AFS cache is configured to use, set
##  this to true.
#RESERVE_AFS_CACHE	= False

##  By default, if a user does not specify "notify_user" in the submit
##  description file, any email Hawkeye sends about that job will go to
##  "username@UID_DOMAIN".  If your machines all share a common UID
##  domain (so that you would set UID_DOMAIN to be the same across all
##  machines in your pool), *BUT* email to user@UID_DOMAIN is *NOT*
##  the right place for Hawkeye to send email for your site, you can
##  define the default domain to use for email.  A common example
##  would be to set EMAIL_DOMAIN to the fully qualified hostname of
##  each machine in your pool, so users submitting jobs from a
##  specific machine would get email sent to user@machine.your.domain,
##  instead of user@your.domain.  In general, you should leave this
##  setting commented out unless two things are true: 1) UID_DOMAIN is
##  set to your domain, not $(FULL_HOSTNAME), and 2) email to
##  user@UID_DOMAIN won't work.
#EMAIL_DOMAIN = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)


######################################################################
##  Daemon-specific settings:
######################################################################


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  hawkeye_master
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Daemons you want the master to keep running for you:
DAEMON_LIST			= MASTER, STARTD, COLLECTOR

##  Which daemons use the Hawkeye DaemonCore library (i.e., not the
##  checkpoint server or custom user daemons)?
#DC_DAEMON_LIST = MASTER, STARTD, SCHEDD, KBDD, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, EVENTD

##  Where are the binaries for these daemons?
MASTER				= $(SBIN)/hawkeye_master
STARTD				= $(SBIN)/hawkeye_startd
COLLECTOR			= $(SBIN)/hawkeye_collector

##  When the master starts up, it can place it's address (IP and port)
##  into a file.  This way, tools running on the local machine don't
##  need to query the central manager to find the master.  This
##  feature can be turned off by commenting out this setting.
MASTER_ADDRESS_FILE = $(LOG)/.master_address

##  If a daemon dies an unnatural death, do you want email about it?
#PUBLISH_OBITUARIES		= True

##  If you're getting obituaries, how many lines of the end of that
##  daemon's log file do you want included in the obituary?
#OBITUARY_LOG_LENGTH		= 20

##  Should the master run?
#START_MASTER			= True

##  Should the master start up the daemons you want it to?
#START_DAEMONS			= True

##  How often do you want the master to send an update to the central
##  manager? 
#MASTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL		= 300

##  How often do you want the master to check the timestamps of the
##  daemons it's running?  If any daemons have been modified, the
##  master restarts them.
#MASTER_CHECK_NEW_EXEC_INTERVAL	= 300

##  Once you notice new binaries, how long should you wait before you
##  try to execute them?
#MASTER_NEW_BINARY_DELAY	= 120

##  What's the maximum amount of time you're willing to give the
##  daemons to quickly shutdown before you just kill them outright?
#SHUTDOWN_FAST_TIMEOUT		= 120

######
##  Exponential backoff settings:
######
##  When a daemon keeps crashing, we use "exponential backoff" so we
##  wait longer and longer before restarting it.  This is the base of
##  the exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting
##  the daemon again:
#MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR		= 2.0

##  What's the maximum amount of time you want the master to wait
##  between attempts to start a given daemon?  (With 2.0 as the
##  MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR, you'd hit 1 hour in 12 restarts...)
#MASTER_BACKOFF_CEILING		= 3600

##  How long should a daemon run without crashing before we consider
##  it "recovered".  Once a daemon has recovered, we reset the number
##  of restarts so the exponential backoff stuff goes back to normal. 
#MASTER_RECOVER_FACTOR		= 300


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  hawkeye_startd
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Where are the various hawkeye_starter binaries installed?
STARTER_LIST		=

##  When the startd starts up, it can place it's address (IP and port)
##  into a file.  This way, tools running on the local machine don't
##  need to query the central manager to find the startd.  This
##  feature can be turned off by commenting out this setting.
STARTD_ADDRESS_FILE	= $(LOG)/.startd_address

##  When a machine is claimed, how often should we poll the state of
##  the machine to see if we need to evict/suspend the job, etc?
#POLLING_INTERVAL        = 5

##  How often should the startd send updates to the central manager? 
UPDATE_INTERVAL         = 30

##  How long is the startd willing to stay in the "matched" state?
#MATCH_TIMEOUT		= 300

##  How long is the startd willing to stay in the preempting/killing
##  state before it just kills the starter directly?
#KILLING_TIMEOUT	= 30

##  When a machine unclaimed, when should it run benchmarks?
##  LastBenchmark is initialized to 0, so this expression says as soon
##  as we're unclaimed, run the benchmarks.  Thereafter, if we're
##  unclaimed and it's been at least 4 hours since we ran the last
##  benchmarks, run them again.  The startd keeps a weighted average
##  of the benchmark results to provide more accurate values.
##  Note, if you don't want any benchmarks run at all, either comment
##  RunBenchmarks out, or set it to "False".
RunBenchmarks = False

##  Normally, when the startd is computing the idle time of all the
##  users of the machine (both local and remote), it checks the utmp
##  file to find all the currently active ttys, and only checks access
##  time of the devices associated with active logins.  Unfortunately,
##  on some systems, utmp is unreliable, and the startd might miss
##  keyboard activity by doing this.  So, if your utmp is unreliable,
##  set this setting to True and the startd will check the access time
##  on all tty and pty devices.
#STARTD_HAS_BAD_UTMP = False

##  The STARTD_EXPRS entry allows you to have the startd advertise
##  arbitrary expressions from the config file in its ClassAd.  Give
##  the comma-separated list of entries from the config file you want
##  in the startd ClassAd.
##  Note: because of the different syntax of the config file and
##  ClassAds, you might have to do a little extra work to get a given
##  entry into the ClassAd.  In particular, ClassAds require "'s
##  around your strings.  Numeric values can go in directly, as can
##  boolean expressions.  For example, if you wanted the startd to
##  advertise its list of console devices, when it's configured to run
##  benchmarks, and how often it sends updates to the central manager,
##  you'd have to define the following helper macro:
#MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES = "$(CONSOLE_DEVICES)"
##  Note: this must come before you define STARTD_EXPRS because macros
##  must be defined before you use them in other macros or
##  expressions.
##  Then, you'd set the STARTD_EXPRS setting to this:
#STARTD_EXPRS = MY_CONSOLE_DEVICES, RunBenchmarks, UPDATE_INTERVAL

##  When the startd is claimed by a remote user, it can also advertise
##  arbitrary attributes from the ClassAd of the job its working on.
##  Just list the attribute names you want advertised.  
##  Note: since this is already a ClassAd, you don't have to do
##  anything funny with strings, etc.  This feature can be turned off
##  by commenting out this setting (there is no default).
STARTD_JOB_EXPRS = ImageSize, ExecutableSize, JobUniverse, NiceUser

##  If you want to "lie" to Hawkeye about how many CPUs your machine
##  has, you can use this setting to override Hawkeye's automatic
##  computation.  If you modify this, you must restart the startd for
##  the change to take effect (a simple hawkeye_reconfig will not do).
##  Please read the section on "hawkeye_startd Configuration File
##  Macros" in the Hawkeye Administrators Manual for a further
##  discussion of this setting.  Its use is not recommended.  This
##  must be an integer ("N" isn't a valid setting, that's just used to
##  represent the default).
#NUM_CPUS = N
NUM_CPUS = 1

##  Normally, Hawkeye will automatically detect the amount of physical
##  memory available on your machine.  Define MEMORY to tell Hawkeye
##  how much physical memory (in MB) your machine has, overriding the
##  value Hawkeye computes automatically.  For example:
#MEMORY = 128

##  How much memory would you like reserved from Hawkeye?  By default,
##  Hawkeye considers all the physical memory of your machine as
##  available to be used by Hawkeye jobs.  If RESERVED_MEMORY is
##  defined, Hawkeye subtracts it from the amount of memory it
##  advertises as available.
#RESERVED_MEMORY = 0
