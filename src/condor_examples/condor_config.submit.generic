##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor.
##
##  This version is for submit-only machines.  Please use another 
##  file if you have different needs by default.
##
##  The file is divided into three main parts: settings you must
##  customize, settings you may want to customize, and settings you
##  should probably leave alone (unless you know what you're doing)
##
##  Please read the INSTALL file (or the Install chapter in the
##  Condor Administrator's Manual) for detailed explanations of the 
##  various settings in here and possible ways to configure your
##  pool. 
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.
##
##  Unless otherwise indicated, all settings which specify a time are
##  defined in seconds.

##  Flocking: Submitting jobs to more than one pool
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  If you would like to run your jobs in other pools, add the central
##  manager hosts for those pools here.  You must also add
##  $(FLOCK_HOSTS) to HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD below.
#FLOCK_HOSTS = condor.friendly.domain, condor.cs.wisc.edu

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Host/IP access levels
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Please see the administrator's manual for details on these
##  settings, what they're for, and how to use them.

##  What machines have administrative rights for your pool?  This
##  defaults to your central manager.  You should set it to the
##  machine(s) where whoever is the condor administrator(s) works
##  (assuming you trust all the users who log into that/those
##  machine(s), since this is machine-wide access you're granting).
HOSTALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR = $(CONDOR_HOST)

##  If there are no machines that should have administrative access 
##  to your pool (for example, there's no machine where only trusted
##  users have accounts), you can uncomment this setting.
##  Unfortunately, this will mean that administering your pool will 
##  be more difficult.
#HOSTDENY_ADMINISTRATOR = *

##  Read access.  Machines listed as allow (and/or not listed as deny)
##  can view the status of your pool, etc.
##  NOTE: By default, without either of these entries specified, you
##  are granting read access to the whole world.  You may want to
##  restrict that to hosts in your domain.  If possible, please also
##  grant read access to "*.cs.wisc.edu", so the Condor developers
##  will be able to view the status of your pool and more easily help
##  you install, configure or debug your Condor installation.
#HOSTALLOW_READ = *.your.domain, *.cs.wisc.edu
#HOSTDENY_READ = *.bad.subnet, bad-machine.your.domain, 144.77.88.*

##  jobs, etc.
#HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain, your-friend's-machine.other.domain

##  Do you want to use AFS for file access instead of remote system

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Do you want to use a checkpoint server?
#USE_CKPT_SERVER	= False

##  If so, what's the hostname?
#CKPT_SERVER_HOST	= checkpoint-server-hostname.your.domain

##  Do you want the starter on the execute machine to choose the
##  checkpoint server?  If False, the CKPT_SERVER_HOST set on
##  the submit machine is used.  The default is false.
#STARTER_CHOOSES_CKPT_SERVER = False

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Miscellaneous:
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  Try to save this much swap space by not starting new shadows.  
##  Specified in megabytes.
#RESERVED_SWAP		= 5

##  What's the maximum number of jobs you want a single submit machine
##  to spawn shadows for?
#MAX_JOBS_RUNNING	= 200

##  Condor needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the condor_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  condor account, it's probably condor.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the CONDOR_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.
LOCK		= $(LOCAL_DIR)/log

##  If you don't use a fully qualified name in your /etc/hosts file
##  (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an alias,
##  Condor wouldn't normally be able to use fully qualified names in
##  places that it'd like to.  You can set this parameter to the
##  domain you'd like appended to your hostname, if changing your host
##  information isn't a good option.  This parameter must be set in
##  the global config file (not the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE from above). 
#DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME = your.domain.name

##  Condor can be told whether or not you want the Condor daemons to
##  create a core file if something really bad happens.  This just
##  sets the resource limit for the size of a core file.  By default,
##  we don't do anything, and leave in place whatever limit was in
##  effect when you started the Condor daemons.  If this parameter is
##  set and "True", we increase the limit to as large as it gets.  If
##  it's set to "False", we set the limit at 0 (which means that no
##  core files are even created).  Core files greatly help the Condor
##  developers debug any problems you might be having.
#CREATE_CORE_FILES	= True

##  Exponential backoff settings:
######
##  When a daemon keeps crashing, we use "exponential backoff" so we
##  wait longer and longer before restarting it.  This is the base of
##  the exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting
##  the daemon again:
#MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR		= 2.0

##  What's the maximum amount of time you want the master to wait
##  between attempts to start a given daemon?  (With 2.0 as the
##  MASTER_BACKOFF_FACTOR, you'd hit 1 hour in 12 restarts...)
#MASTER_BACKOFF_CEILING		= 3600

##  How long should a daemon run without crashing before we consider

##  condor_shadow
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##  If the shadow is unable to read a checkpoint file from the
##  checkpoint server, it keeps trying only if the job has accumulated
##  more than MAX_DISCARDED_RUN_TIME seconds of CPU usage.  Otherwise,

##  If you want condor_submit to automatically append an expression to

#APPEND_REQUIREMENTS	= (expression to append job requirements)
#APPEND_RANK		= (expression to append job rank)

##  If you want expressions only appended for either standard or

##  the generic entries above.
#APPEND_REQ_VANILLA	= (expression to append to vanilla job requirements)
#APPEND_REQ_STANDARD	= (expression to append to standard job requirements)
#APPEND_RANK_STANDARD	= (expression to append to vanilla job rank)
#APPEND_RANK_VANILLA	= (expression to append to standard job rank)

##  This can be used to define a default value for the rank expression
##  if one is not specified in the submit file.
#DEFAULT_RANK	        = (default rank expression for all jobs)

##  If you want universe-specific defaults, you can use the following
##  entries:
#DEFAULT_RANK_VANILLA	= (default rank expression for vanilla jobs)
#DEFAULT_RANK_STANDARD	= (default rank expression for standard jobs)

##  If you want condor_submit to automatically append expressions to
##  the job ClassAds it creates, you can uncomment and define the
##  SUBMIT_EXPRS setting.  It works just like the STARTD_EXPRS
##  described above with respect to ClassAd vs. config file syntax,
##  strings, etc.  One common use would be to have the full hostname
##  of the machine where a job was submitted placed in the job
##  ClassAd.  You would do this by uncommenting the following lines: 
#MACHINE = "$(FULL_HOSTNAME)"
#SUBMIT_EXPRS = MACHINE

## Condor keeps a buffer of recently-used data for each file an
