This README file describes the DRMAA Condor UNIX C library.  

GENERAL: libDrmaa.a

  This library was developed from the Distributed Resource Management Application
API Specification 1.0 of January 2004 and the DRMAA C Bindings v0.9 of September
2003.  Both were available at time of writing at www.drmaa.org.
   This is a static C library.  It expects a POSIX thread model on UNIX systems
and a Windows thread model on Windows.  Unix systems that don't support POSIX
threads are not guaranteed thread safety when calling the library's functions.
It contains support for the Condor DRMS only and has been tested with Condor
6.6.0.
  The library supports most of the functionality of the DRMAA 1.0 API, certainly
the core functionality.  See the "Items Not Supported" section below for
details about what has not yet been fully implemented.

REQUIRMENTS:

  The library requires the following in order to operate.  The program linked
to the library is referred to as the "user process".
   1) A local schedd must be running
   2) The user process must have sufficient spool space.  This space should be
in /tmp or specified by the environment variables TEMP, TMP, or SPOOL.  The
user process and local schedd must have read, write, and traverse rights to the
 spool space.

ITEMS NOT SUPPORTED:
	
   The following list includes all API specifications not currently supported,
organized by section number of the specification.

- 2.4.1 job categories 
- 3.2.3.1  the following mandatory attributes:
	job working directory (DRMAA_WD),
	job category (DRMAA_JOB_CATEGORY),
	job start time (DRMAA_START_TIME),
	job name (DRMAA_JOB_NAME),
	join files (DRMAA_JOIN_FILES)
- 3.2.3.2 none of the optional attributes
- 3.2.4 drmaa_run_bulk_jobs()
- 3.2.5 
   drmaa_synchronize() - DRMAA_JOB_IDS_SESSION_ALL functionality
   drmaa_wait() - DRMAA_JOB_IDS_SESSION_ANY functionality
   drmaa_synchronize() - DRMAA_JOB_IDS_SESSION_ALL functionality
   drmaa_wtermsig()
   drmaa_wcoredump()

SUPPORTED JOB ATTRIBUTES:

   The library currently supports the following job attributes:
     DRMAA_REMOTE_COMMAND,
     DRMAA_JS_STATE,
     DRMAA_NATIVE_SPECIFICATION,
     DRMAA_BLOCK_EMAIL, 
     DRMAA_INPUT_PATH, 
     DRMAA_OUTPUT_PATH, 
     DRMAA_ERROR_PATH, 
     DRMAA_V_ARGV,  
     DRMAA_V_ENV, 
     DRMAA_V_EMAIL
Note that DRMAA_NATIVE_SPECIFICATION can be used to set all attributes supported
in Condor submit discription files (see Condor manual's man page for
condor_submit).
