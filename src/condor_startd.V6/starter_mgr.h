  This file defines the StarterMgr class, the "starter manager".  This
  object is responsible for reading the STARTER_LIST config file
  attribute, getting the classads for all the starters listed there,
  and managing those ClassAds.  It knows how to publish information
  about the starter capabilities into a given classad, (like a
  resource ad for each vm), and how to do match making between a given
  job and the various starters.

  ! ! ! BEWARE ! ! !

  The ShadowMgr object in the schedd is based pretty heavily on this
  object.  There was no easy way to share the code via common base
  classes, and the Starter and Shadow objects are very different from
  each other.  However, most of the code in
  condor_schedd.V6/shadow_mgr.[Ch] was lifted from here.  If you
  change anything in here, you should check in those two files, too,
  and make sure you don't need to make the same change on that side.
