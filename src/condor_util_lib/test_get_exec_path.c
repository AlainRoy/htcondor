   This is not really meant to be an automated test (though it could
   possibly be modified to be one.  It was just written to verify that
   this function worked while it was being developed.

   If you give this program any argument (it doesn't matter what it
   is), it will fork off a child process which will exec() the test
   program again, attempting to fool it as best it can (giving a
   faulty argv[0], not giving a full path to exec() and relying on the
   PATH, etc.)
