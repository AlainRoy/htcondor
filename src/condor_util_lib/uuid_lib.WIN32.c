/*
 HACK: These are the values for the GUIDs (globally unique identifiers
 that are used in condor_mail and the windows_firewall COM code.

 Normally, we'd link these in from uuid.lib, however, uuid.lib in the
 XP SP2 SDK is "fundamentally incompatible" (says Microsoft support)
 with the VC6 linker. All this, despite their XP SP2 SDK documentation
 claiming in multiple places that the new SDK is compatible with both
 .NET and VC6. Sigh.  So for now, we'll define them ourselves, and at our
 earliest convenience move kicking and screaming into the world of .NET.
