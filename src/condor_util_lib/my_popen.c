  This is just like popen(3) except it isn't quite as smart in some
  ways, but is smarter in others.  This one is less smart in that it
  only allows for one process at a time.  It is smarter than at least
  some implementation of standard popen() in that it handles
  termination of the child process more carefully.  First, it is aware
  that the calling code may be set up to catch SIGCHLD.  Since one
  instance of SIGCHLD will be generated by each call to my_popen(),
  each call must eat one instance of SIGCHLD.  Secondly, it is careful
  how it waits for it's child's status so that it doesn't reap status
  information for other processes which the calling code may want to
  reap.
