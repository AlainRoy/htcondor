This is the README for the PVM examples directory of the Condor
distribution.  The Condor-PVM Contrib must be installed to run PVM
applications in Condor.

This directory currently contains only one example.  It is a simple
example of a master-worker style PVM application which is well-suited
to non-dedicated opportunistic environment like Condor.  The files in
this example are:

  in_sum - input file for PVM sum example program, which sets the
    number of workers
  master_sum.c - source code for the PVM master
  submit_sum - job description file for condor_submit
  sum.h - header file containing message tag constants
  worker_sum.c - source code for the PVM workers

To build, edit PVM_ROOT, PVM_ARCH, and any other necessary settings in
the Makefile and run "make".  To submit to Condor, run "condor_submit
submit_sum".
