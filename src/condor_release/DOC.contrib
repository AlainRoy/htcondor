The documentation for Condor can be found on the World Wide Web at:

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual

At that web site, you will find both an on-line version of manual and
directions for downloading your own copy in a variety of formats. 

For "contrib" modules, such as the SMP-startd, DagMan, PVM support,
etc, be sure to look at the Condor Version 6.1 manual, not the 6.0
manual.
