/*
**	Shadow exit statuses which reflect the exit status of the job
*/

/* ok, because of strange exit codes from the util lib and such(which
	shouldn't be there, but that story is for another time), we can't
	be totally sure that the exit values with low numbers will mean
	what we think they mean. So I'm offsetting the exit codes from the
	shadow so that we know for sure(relatively anyway) what happened.
	Any exit code less than the offset should be treated as a shadow
	exception. Please make sure you don't roll over 255 in the return
	code. For legacy reasons DPRINTF_ERROR and JOB_EXCEPTION must
	remain the same. */
