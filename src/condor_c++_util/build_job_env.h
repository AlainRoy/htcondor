/** Given a job's classad, return environment variables job should get.

Note that anything set should be overridable by the user (notably using the
"env=" option in the submit file).

This includes:
- X509_USER_PROXY

This should eventually include:
- Condor provided environment like _CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR
- "POSIX" stuff (Possible inclusion: LOGNAME (aka username),
  HOME, SHELL, PATH.  Less likely: USER, USERNAME, PWD, TZ, TERM)

This might, but may not eventually include:
- Contents of the ATTR_JOB_ENVIRONMENT

Typical use might look something like this (taken from
condor_starter.V6.1/starter.C)

		Env * proc_env; // Comes from outside
		bool using_file_transfer; // Comes from outside
		StringMap classenv = build_job_env(JobAd, using_file_transfer);
		sm.startIterations();
		MyString key,value;
		while(sm.iterate(key,value)) {
			proc_env->Put(key.Value(),value.Value());
		}

Input:

ad - The jobs classad.  It is assumed that ATTR_JOB_IWD is set to
something meanful _locally_.  (condor_starter.V6.1 rewrites
ATTR_JOB_IWD to be the local execute directory if the job uses
file transfer.  This is correct behavior.)

using_file_transfer - Was file transfer used?  Relevant because
sometimes we need to rewrite paths.
