/* Here is the version string - update before a public release */
/* --- IMPORTANT!  THE FORMAT OF THE VERSION STRING IS VERY STRICT
   BECAUSE IT IS PARSED AT RUNTIME.  DO NOT ALTER THE FORMAT OR ENTER
   ANYTHING EXTRA BEFORE THE DATE.  IF YOU WISH TO ADD EXTRA INFORMATION,
   DO SO _AFTER_ THE DATE AND BEFORE THE TRAILING '$' CHARACTER.
   EXAMPLES:
       $CondorVersion: 6.1.11 " __DATE__ " WinNTPreview $    [OK]
	   $CondorVersion: 6.1.11 WinNTPreview " __DATE__ " $	 [WRONG!!!]
   Any questions?  See Todd or Derek.  Note: if you mess it up, DaemonCore
   will EXCEPT at startup time.

/* 
   This is some wisdom from Cygnus's web page.  If you just try to use
   the "stringify" operator on a preprocessor directive, you'd get
   "PLATFORM", not "Intel Linux" (or whatever the value of PLATFORM
   is).  That's because the stringify operator is a special case, and
   the preprocessor isn't allowed to expand things that are passed to
   it.  However, by defining two layers of macros, you get the right
   behavior, since the first pass converts:

   xstr(PLATFORM) -> str(Intel Linux)

   and the next pass gives:

   str(Intel Linux) -> "Intel Linux"

   This is exactly what we want, so we use it.  -Derek Wright and Jeff
   Ballard, 12/2/99 

   Also, because the NT build system is totally different, we have to
   define the correct platform string right in here. :( -Derek 12/3/99
