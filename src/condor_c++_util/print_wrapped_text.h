/** Print a single paragraph of text, wrapping it properly on each
    line. This is particularly useful when you don't know how long
    your text will be in advance, like when you have a filename as
    part of your text.  You should not use tabs or newlines embedded
    in the string, as that will confuse this method.  Tabs at the
    beginning and extra newlines at the end are fine, however.  You
    get a single newline at the end of the paragraph automatically. 
	@param text The text to print.
	@param output Where to print the text to, like stdout
	@param chars_per_line The maximum number of characters to print per line.
           This defaults to 78 characters, which is a reasonable guess.
