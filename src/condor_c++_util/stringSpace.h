/**
 * A string space is an efficient way to manage memory for character
 * strings.
 * <p>
 * <b>Introduction:</b>
 * <br>
 * A StringSpace is designed to handle large numbers of immutable
 * string values many of which are logically identical.  In addition,
 * it is assumed that the lifetimes of these values vary widely among
 * individual instances of the values.  The string space structure
 * shares storage for values, and uses a reference to this shared
 * storage.  The storage is maintained by reference counting.  All
 * accesses to the string value are then performed through this
 * reference, which may be copied and deleted without regard to
 * storage managment.

 * <p>
 * <b>Informal comments on usage:</b>
 * <br>
 * The basic object in the system is the StringSpace, of which one may
 * have several non-interfering instances.  The primary method defined
 * on the object is the 'getCanonical' method which enters a ASCIIZ
 * string into the string space, and returns an SSString object.  The
 * SSString object is the reference to the string, and all further
 * accesses to the string should be performed using the SSString
 * object.  (If the string already exists in the string space, a
 * reference to the original string is returned.)  An additional
 * advantage that can be exploited is that each *distinct* string
 * value is given a unique integer ID, with identical strings sharing
 * the same ID.  (e.g., this can be used for fast string equality
 * comparisons!)  The SSString object has operations that can be used
 * to copy and dispose references appropriately.
 * <p>
 * <b>Memory management convention in the StringSpace:</b>
 * <br>
 * The default behavior for the StringSpace is that it initially
 * allocates storage for an inserted string.  This default is
 * reflected in the default argument SS_DUP of the getCanonical
 * method.  However, it may be that the client of the interface has
 * already allocated storage for the string, and merely wants to hand
 * it off the string space who will then assume full responsibility
 * for its storage management.  This can be accomplished by passing
 * SS_ADOPT_C_STRING or SS_ADOPT_C_PLUS_STRING to the getCanonical
 * method depending on whether the string was created with malloc( )
 * or with new[ ].
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> The dispose() method of the SSString is meant to be used
 * in unusual situations only.  Note that the destructor takes care of
 * disposing the reference, so explicitly calling the dispose method
 * may lead to incorrect memory management.  */
