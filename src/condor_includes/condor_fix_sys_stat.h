/*
On many platforms, stat defines several static functions
which redirect stat to xstat, fstat to fxstat, and so on.
We want to kill all of these definitions right here
and then provide prototypes for the libc versions
of stat and friends.

The whole point of this is to enable us to redefine
the libc versions of stat and friends as we please.
We only perform this action when CONDOR_KILL_STAT_DEFINITIONS
is in effect.  This should probably only be set
by the syscall library.

Notice that a #define stat is not what we want -- this
will clobber all sorts of arguments and structures that
use the symbol stat.  By defining a macros with arguments,
stat(), we will only kill the static function definition.
