- document, document, document
  - condor_submit -a
  - asynchronous PRE/POST
  - check CVS logs for more...
  - update README.txt & code comments

- scalability testing

- test stupid dags
  - no ready jobs
  - cycles
  - no jobs

? move lockfile handling to dagman_main & unlink only if normal exit
? back-port 6.3 DAGMan to Condor 6.2
  - PROBLEM: without new condor_submit, submit-event-matching cannot
    work reliably b/c of async PRE/POST scripts


=== bugs

x dagman needs to return failure if a node fails
x termq bug
x segfault bugs
x recovery broken


=== new features

- take a signal to exit & generate a rescue file
- replace _done kludge in script.C with a new job state?

x support throttling of PRE & POST scripts
x get rid of GetSubmittedJob() code and replace with a waiting-job
  list, etc.
x get DAGMan job id and use in submit_submit() rather than "(-1.-1)"


=== Miron Ideas ===

- when you recover the log, every time you see a submit, make sure the
  waiting queue of that job is empty

- use liberal assert()s

- talk w/Miron about adding a submit API to condor as part of my
  DAGMan work
