  This file defines the ShadowMgr class, the "shadow manager".
  This object is responsible for reading the SHADOW_LIST config
  file attribute, getting the classads for all the shadows listed
  there, and managing those ClassAds.  It knows how to do match
  making between a given job and the various shadows.

  ! ! ! BEWARE ! ! !

  These two objects are based pretty heavily on the Starter and
  StarterMgr objects in the startd.  There was no easy way to share
  the code via common base classes, and the Starter and Shadow objects
  are very different from each other.  However, most of the code in
  here was lifted from condor_startd.V6/Starter.h and
  condor_startd.V6/starter_mgr.h.  If you change anything in here, you
  should check in those two files, too, and make sure you don't need
  to make the same change on that side.
