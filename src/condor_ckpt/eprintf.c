/* We compile condor libraries with GNU gcc/g++.  However, we want user to be
 * able to link these libraries with cc, f77, etc., perhaps on systems where GNU
 * is not installed.  
 *
 * The GNU standard C libraries (libgcc, et all) sometimes include functions 
 * which are required and yet non-standard.  These functions cause problems for
 * folks trying to link in the Condor libraries with non-GNU compilers.
 *
 * __eprintf() is one of those functions, so we include an __eprintf here.
