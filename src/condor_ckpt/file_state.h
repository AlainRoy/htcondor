/**
This class multiplexes number of UNIX file system calls.
The fd's used to index this table are "virtual file descriptors",
and could refer to real fds, remote fds, ioservers, sockets,
or who knows what.
<p>
It only makes sense to use this table when MappingFileDescriptors()
is in effect.  If it is not, just perform syscalls remotely or
locally, as the SyscallMode indicates.
<p>
This class does several things:
<dir> 
	<li> checks validity of vfds  
	<li> multiplexes vfds to file types
	<li> buffers seek pointers   
	<li> talks to the buffer cache
	<li> oversees checkpoint and restore
</dir>

This class does _not_:
<dir>
	<li> Decide whether mapping is in effect.
	     The system call stubs do that.
	<li> Implement read, write, seek, etc. for _any_ file.
	     Subclasses of File do that (file_types.C)
	<li> Implement buffering.
	     A BufferCache does that (buffer_cache.C)
	<li> Perform operations on names (i.e. stat()).
	     To operate on a name, open() it, and
	     then perform the fd equivalent of that op.
	     (i.e. fstat())  
</dir>

The file table has two sub-structures, File and FilePointer.
<p>
Each integer file descriptor (fd) indexes a file pointer (fp) in
the open file table.  Each fp stores a current seek pointer
and a pointer to the file object (fo) associated with that fd.
<p>
So, when a dup is performed, two fds will point to the same fp,
which points to a single fo.  All operations on the same fd will
manipulate the same seek pointer and the same file data.
<pre>
fd  fd
|  /
fp
|
fo
</pre>
<p>
If, however, the same file is opened again, a new fd and new fp
are allocated, but the same file object is shared with the previous
fds.  This allows the separation of seek pointers, but operations on
the third fd will still affect the data present in the first two.
<pre>
fd  fd  fd
|  /    |
fp      fp
|      /
|    /
|  /
fo
</pre>
<p>
Various implementations of File can be found in file_types.[hC].
