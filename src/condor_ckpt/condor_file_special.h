/**
There are several items which look like files, but Condor does not know
how to checkpoint.  We will allow the use of things like pipes and sockets,
but we must inhibit checkpointing while these endpoints exist.

This object blocks the appropriate signals in its constructor and then
resumes those signals in the destructor.  When none of these objects are
in the file table, checkpointing is allowed.
