# The point of this is
# First make all of the crap (mostly .o files)
# then make my driver program .o file
# then make the library against which my program will linke--this library has to use the new
# .o files in this directory (talk about horrible build systems....)
# make release moves all of the crap to the lib dir
# finally run the whole damn thing through condor compile. This produces a rather plump executable.
