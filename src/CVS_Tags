12/03/93	Preliminary_CVS:A
	Installed on Ultrix 4.2 non AFS DecStations
01/06/94	Preliminary_Ultrix4_3a:A
	Installed on Ultrix 4.3a with AFS DecStations - does not support
	checkpointing or access to files within the AFS file tree.
01/10/94	Sparc_Sunos4_1:A
	Installed on both instructional and research suns.
01/11/94	Sparc_Sunos4_1:A
	Installed on both instructional and research suns.  Purpose to fix
	bug caused by calling popen() to run "fs" command when reserving
	file space for the AFS cache.  Replaced popen() with my_popen()
	which is more careful to only reap the one child process it starts,
	and to eat up one instance of SIGCHLD for the child it starts.
01/17/94	Jan_17_94
	Fixed memory leaks in condor_startd using purify.  Installed
	only condor_startd on local MIPS_ULTRIX42 machines.
02/23/94	V3:A
	Applies only to src/condor_ckpt.  The checkpointing code with saving
	and restoring the state of open files.  Only runs on the Alphas,
	but compiles on the R6000's (haven't built a syscall() routine
	for the 6000's yet).  Does not cover memory mapped files.
02/27/94	V4:A
	Applies to src/condor_ckpt src/condor_includes config.
	The checkpointing code with saving and restoring state of ordinary
	files.  Runs on OSF/1, HP-UX9, Ultrix4.2a, Ultrix 4.3a, SunOs 4.1.3
	and compiles on Aix 3.2.  Haven't tried to get to run on AIX yet
	because I need to build a syscall() routine there.
04/19/94	DecAlpha_Almost
	Applies to
		src/condor_ckpt
		src/condor_syscall_lib
		src/h
		src/condor_includes
		src/condor_c++_util
		src/condor_util_lib
		src/condor_xdr_lib
		src/condor_test_suite
		src/condor_starter.Alpha
		src/condor_shadow.Alpha
		config
	Mostly working version of remote system calls.  Works with or
	without starter, but in either case only in "debugging" mode -
	the mode where we use named pipes to simulate the TCP
	connections to the shadow.
4/26/94 DecApha_CKPT_Local_Remote
	This one works for both local and remote checkpoint/restart on the
	alpha.  Only tested in the "debugging" mode where we use named
	pipes to communicate with the shadow.  Also not tested under the
	starter, but in the mode where the user program makes its shadow
	connections itself and reads the command stream from a file.
	Contains many "hacks" to get the remote restart to work.
4/27/94 IBM_version
    Version actually checked out earlier on AIX 3.2.5.  Checked in
    now using "cvs tag" (not rtag), to make sure I can reproduce.
    Intend to give this version to Bob Mikrut of DoIt on 4/28/94.
4/28/94 DoIt_1
	Version with no AFS access and some AIX 3.2.5 problems fixed up.  Can
	at least build, run, and run the "loop" program.
5/14/94 DecApha_CKPT_Local_Remote_2
	This one works for both local and remote checkpoint/restart on the
	alpha.  Only tested in the "debugging" mode where we use named
	pipes to communicate with the shadow.  Also not tested under the
	starter, but in the mode where the user program makes its shadow
	connections itself and reads the command stream from a file.
	Many previous "hacks" fixed up.  No longer depends on constructors
	to initialize objects at global scope - all constructors removed
	from the checkpointing code.  Also uses CONDOR_get_file_stream
	to read checkpoint files and CONDOR_put_file_stream to write
	them - faster and symmetric.
5/19/94 DecAlpha_Task4
	Dec Alpha OSF/1 v1.3 - runs test jobs submitted in normal way using
	Shaodow, Startd, and Starter.  Done with normal remote system call
	connection via TCP.
5/25/94 DecAlpha_a1
	Dec Alpha OSF/1 v1.3 - Pretty much every thing works here, all the
	deamons (including collector and negotiator), tools, etc.  Everything
	has been checked in, checked back out, re-compiled from scratch,
	and tested.
5/27/94 DecAlpha_a2
	Everything from "DecAlpha_a1", plus customization program for creating
	site specific versions of "script files" from platform specific ones.
6/7/94 DecAlpha_a3
	Includes test programs for C, C++, and Fortran, plus a few minor bug
	fixes which were necessary to get all the test programs running.
6/9/94 DecAlpha_a4
	Fixes memory leak in schedd and problem where condor_rm didn't kill
	remotely running process.
6/14/94 DecAlpha_a5
	Supports generation of "examples" and "doc" directories for binary
	distribution.
6/14/94 DecAlpha_a6
	Released to the world as "Condor_5.1a_DecAlpha".
	
* 6/22/94 bp_Local_Sun_Dec (Branch Point Tag)
	This is the code running on our local pool Dec and Suns since around
	2/11/94.  It is tagged with a "date" option for that date.  This
	is to become the "local branch" Local_Sun_Dec which is intended to
	include small improvements and patches to the local code.

6/22/94 Local_Sun_Dec
	This is the initial version of "latest local code" based on the above
	bp_Local_Sun_Dec branch.
	
6/24/94 Local_Sun_Dec_2
	Installed on both Sun and Dec in local pool this date.  Includes
	use of AFS for file transfers, but not user code accesses to
	data.  File transfers include
		checkpoint file:		from submitting to executing machine
		checkpoint file:		from executing machine to submitting machine
		(abnormal) core file:	from executing machine to submitting machine

6/27/94 bp_Alpha_Alpha (Branch Point Tag)
	Alpha release of Condor for Dec Alpha.  This is (very close to) the
	code released on the net as "Condor_5.1a_DecAlpha".  (This branch
	point should have been created at the release date, but was created
	later.)

6/27/94 Alpha_Alpha (Branch Point Tag)
	Alpha release of Condor for Dec Alpha.  This tag refers to the 
	latest code on the Alpha_Alpha branch.  It is intended for any
	minor fixes which may be needed for that distribution, not
	general development.

7/3/94 V5_Alpha_Sparc_1
	V5 code which compiles and works on both Dec Alpha and Sparc Sunos
	platforms - clipped wing version only.  Tested very little.

7/21/94 SparcSunos_a1
	Limited Release to the world as "Condor_5.1a_SunOS".

7/27/94 V5_a2
	Released in department on Sun and Alpha.  Known bugs
		1. Vanilla jobs run by users other than "condor" crash
		2. Jobs which execute non-supported syscalls remain in queue forever
