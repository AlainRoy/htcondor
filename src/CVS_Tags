12/08/03 V6_7-core-branch
   A new branch off of V6_7-branch for adding some custom features for
   CORE.  These include:
   - disconnected shadow/starter (and schedd/startd) operation, so
     that vanilla jobs can continue to make progress even if the
     submit machine crashes, reboots, etc.
   - group-based accounting in the schedd + negotiator
   Created from the V6_7-core-root tag.  We will merge this branch

   Just want to get all of the bug fixes and other minor changes since
   the last merge into V6_7-branch before we start making lots of
   other branches off of that (core, unicore, stork, stale-classads,
   etc).

   This is after V6_6_0, but before V6_6_1.  This is the first merge
   from V6_6-branch -> V6_7-branch.  it includes the entire autoconf +
   externals build system, the rh8 full port, an updated copyright
   notice, and all the bug fixes for V6_6_0 (and some that will show
   up for V6_6_1). 

11/27/03 V6_6-branch-post-redhat80-fullport-checkin
	This is the state of the V6_6-branch just after I checked in the full
	port for the redhat 8.0 revision of Linux.

11/27/03 V6_6-branch-pre-redhat80-fullport-checkin
	This is the state of the V6_6-branch just before I checked in the full
	port for the redhat 8.0 revision of Linux.

11/14/03 V6_6_0
   The official 6.6.0 release tag!  This is a re-tagging of
   "BUILD-V6_6-branch-2003-11-13" and "BUILD-V6_6_0-2003-11-12" (both
   of which might go away eventually).  This tag lives on the
   V6_6-branch for the V6_6_ALL module, and on the trunk for the
   entire externals tree.  In NMI land most of the binaries/tarballs
   came from build ID 1715.  The test suite ran on most platforms via
   build #1707 (equivalent source tag).  Solaris 9 and MacOSX had to
   be tested by hand, and Alpha-DUX-40f had to be built and tested by
   hand due to unexplainable errors building the globus external via
   the nightly builds.  Hopefully IRIX will use this same tag
   eventually, but right now, we don't have a functional build machine
   to use.  Maybe NMI will be stable enough to do the full build by
   6.6.1.  The version string for all platforms (except IRIX and maybe
   windows) is: "$CondorVersion: 6.6.0 Nov 13 2003 $"
   NOTE: this is also the last tag of the source that includes all the
   build system wisdom regarding X86 Solaris, Solaris 2.5.1, IRIX 6.2,
   and pre-glibc versions of Linux (everything before rh7.2, in fact).
   I modified all the build system files to purge these platforms
   since we're no longer supporting them, and they were causing
   needless complication in various ways.  This change also
   corresponds with moving platform detection from condor_imake into
   the configure script under the new build system.  Finally, i purged
   a bunch of really old code from condor_ckpt and condor_syscall_lib,
   such as: AIX3.2, ULTRIX, SUNOS, HPUX9, and IRIX53.

11/10/03 HAWKEYE_V1_0_RC3
    Release Candidate 3 of Hawkeye 1.0.

11/04/03 V6_6_0-analyze
   The 6.6.0 version of condor_analyze, which lives on the trunk.  The
   condor_analyze we include in 6.6.0 is really a version of condor_q
   from the trunk with new classads.  it was built manually on linux
   (i386_rh72), and will be included in the 6.6.0 tarballs for that
   platform by the build system.  The condor_analyze binaries included
   in 6.6.0 have this version string: 
   "$CondorVersion: 6.6.0 Nov  5 2003 CONDOR_ANALYZE-BETA $"

10/22/03 V6_6-post_merge_V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-branch after merging the
   V6_6-externals-branch as tagged at V6_6-externals-merge-1.
   The V6_6-externals-branch is now abandonded.

10/22/03 V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-externals-branch when it was merged back into
   V6_6-branch.  We'll abandon the V6_6-externals-branch after this
   merge, and move all development on the new system onto the
   V6_6-branch for the 6.6.x stable series.

10/22/03 V6_6-pre_merge_V6_6-externals-merge-1
   The state of the V6_6-branch before merging the
   V6_6-externals-branch as tagged at V6_6-externals-merge-1.

10/03/03 V6_7-soap-branch
   A new branch off V6_7-branch to hold our initial effort
   at incorporating SOAP interfaces into the Condor daemons.
   Primary goal of producing snapshots for our SciDac collaborators
   at LBNL to produce a demo using our soap work at SuperComputing.
   Created from the V6_7-soap-root tag.  We will merge this branch
   back into V6_7-branch once it stabilizes more... ideally after
   V6_7-branch has the List of Shame work (so we can add gSOAP as
   an external), but before we go back to the trunk.

9/25/03 V6_6-externals-branch
   A new branch off the V6_6-branch for checking in the solution to
   the "list of shame": the new "externals" directory and related
   changes to our Imake system.  This will be a short-lived branch.
   Once everything is working on all our platforms, this branch will
   be merged back into V6_6-branch and abandoned.  The only reason it
   exists is so that the V6_6-branch isn't broken while we work out
   the kinks with the new externals system.  Created from the
   V6_6-externals-root tag.  Does *not* include doc (since there's no
   user visible changes to document).

9/12/03 V6_7-tdp-branch
   A new branch off V6_7-branch for continued work on the TDP (Tool
   Daemon Protocol).  Created from the V6_7-tdp-root tag.  We will
   attempt to merge the older V6_5-tdp-2-branch into this.

9/11/03 V6_7-branch
   A new branch off the end of the V6_5-branch for the 6.7.x
   development series.  Created from the V6_6-root tag.  Includes the
   doc directory.

9/11/03 V6_6-branch
   A new branch off the end of the V6_5-branch for the 6.6.x stable
   series.  Created from the V6_6-root tag.  Includes the doc
   directory.

9/11/03 V6_5_5
   The 6.5.5 release tag.  It's also the end of the V6_5-branch, and
   the same versions of files as the root of V6_6-branch and
   V6_7-branch (although those will have their own tags, as well).  In
   addition to everything in the V6_5_ALL module, V6_5_5 is also found
   in the gahp directory (which lives next to src, config, and so on)
   on the trunk.

9/4/03 V6_5-dag-java-fix
   The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.5 DAGMan
   executable sent to Jens at Fermi (see condor-admin #7370).
   "6.5.5 Sep  4 2003 PRE-RELEASE" is the version string.
   This fixes a bug that caused DAGMan post scripts to be run with
   the signal mask not fully open (resulting in java hanging when
   run in a post script).

8/25/03 V6_5-dag-crash-fix
   The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.5 DAGMan
   executable sent to Duncan and Scott at UW-Milwaukee (see condor-admin
   #7292).  "6.5.5 Aug 25 2003 PRE-RELEASE" is the version string.
   This fixes a bug in the logging of events to the *.dagman.out file
   that may have caused DAGMan crashes Duncan and Scott have seen.

8/12/03 V6_5-post-gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
   The state of the V6_5-branch after merging in the
   V6_5-gridshell3-branch as tagged at gridshell-vdt_1_1_10

8/12/03 V6_5-pre-gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
   The state of the V6_5-branch before merging in the
   V6_5-gridshell3-branch as tagged at gridshell-vdt_1_1_10

8/12/03 gridshell-vdt_1_1_10
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell3-branch that was used to build the
    gridshell-related binarines (condor_gridmanager and
    condor_gridshell) that were used in the VDT 1.1.10 release.
    (note: the V6_5-gridshell3-branch only exists for src and config)

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell3-post-V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell3-branch after it had the changes
    from V6_5-gridshell2-branch (as tagged at V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1)
    merged in.

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell3-branch
   A new branch off of V6_5-branch for further GridShell work.
   Depending on the state of the CVS repository and our plans for the
   GridShell, when this is completed, it'll either get merged into the
   V6_6-branch or the V6_7-branch.  Created from V6_5-gridshell3-root,
   so it'll be easy to merge these changes into any other branch as
   needed.  We needed a 3rd gridshell branch because of more bug fixes
   to the starter on V6_5-branch for COD that we want in the
   gridshell.  So, we made a new branch and will merge the changes
   from V6_5-gridshell2-branch into here..  

7/29/03 V6_5-gridshell2-merge-1
    The state of the V6_5-gridshell2-branch when it was merged into
    V6_5-gridshell3-branch and then abandoned.

7/28/03 V6_5_4
   The 6.5.4 release, which lives on the V6_5-branch. 

7/22/03 V6_5-gridshell2-branch
   A new branch off of V6_5-branch for adding support for the
   GridShell.  depending on the state of the CVS repository and our
   plans for the GridShell, when this is completed, it'll either get
   merged into the V6_6-branch or the V6_7-branch.  Created from
   V6_5-gridshell2-root, so it'll be easy to merge these changes into
   any other branch as needed.  We needed a 2nd gridshell branch
   because some changes were made to the starter on V6_5-branch for
   COD that we need in the gridshell, and it was easier to just make a
   new branch (since nothing had been checked into the old one).

7/18/03 V6_5_4-COD-contrib-2
    The state of the V6_5-branch used for a pre-release 6.5.4 COD
    contrib module sent to Maarten at MIT (see [condor-admin #6613]).
    "$CondorVersion: 6.5.4 Jul 18 2003 COD-PRE-RELEASE $" is the
    version string I sent it with.  this fixes the minor bug in the
    startd where it would EXCEPT() since we were clearing out the job
    classad of all claims (not just COD claims) once the job exited. 

7/15/03 V6_5-gridshell-branch
   A new branch off of V6_5-branch for adding support for the
   GridShell.  depending on the state of the CVS repository and our
   plans for the GridShell, when this is completed, it'll either get
   merged into the V6_6-branch or the V6_7-branch.  Created from
   V6_5-gridshell-root, so it'll be easy to merge these changes into
   any other branch as needed.

    Release Candidate 2 of Hawkeye 1.0.

04/10/03 V6_5_1_a

   package--they are not changes to the Condor code.

04/09/03 V6_5-post-merge-V6_5_1
   The V6_5-branch just before merging in the changes from V6_5_0-branch
   as tagged at V6_5_1 and since tagged at V6_5_0-merge-1.

04/09/03 V6_5-pre-merge-V6_5_1
   The V6_5-branch just before merging in the changes from V6_5_0-branch

    The state of the V6_5_0 branch after merging in
    V6_5_0-tcp_update-branch as tagged at V6_5_0-tcp_update-merge-1.
    this enables condor to send TCP updates to the collector (which
    now uses a SocketCache) if the right things are defined in the
    config file.  flocking is not yet dealt with.  this was required
    by D0 but might be generally useful to other sites.

    the merge-from tag for the final merge of
    V6_5-MB-V6_5-cod-merge-1-branch into the V6_5-branch.

03/04/03 V6_5-MB-V6_5-cod-merge-1-post_merge
    post_merge tag to demark the point after the basic CVS conflict
    resolution was done, and when the more complicated code changes
    where started to get this branch building and working again.

03/04/03 V6_5-MB-V6_5-cod-merge-1-branch
    the *right* name for the COD->V6_5 merge branch.  because of the
    extensive changes required for COD and various things that were
    changed on V6_5 (how CEDAR authenticate() works, and the starter
    exception userlog event), i decided to use a merge-branch for this
    merge so that we can track the changes i had to make to resolve
    conflicts and get everything working after the merge.

03/04/03 V6_5-merge-V6_5-cod-branch
    a failed attempt at a merge-branch for merging COD into
    V6_5-branch.  this is *NOT* the right naming scheme, so i'm
    abandoning the branch (and no one else should use this convention
    in the future).  unfortunately, i couldn't get CVS to just remove
    this tag completely. :( 

03/03/03 V6_5-cod-merge-1

	development, and then be hardened for another stable release.
	as soon as the trunk (new classads) porting is done in the
	most basic level, and daemons with new classads can run jobs
	and pass the test suite, we will freeze development in 6_5,

8/10/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-done
        I finished the port a while ago, but here is a tag specifying
        the set of files where I considered the port to be finished.

7/29/01 V6_3_0-pre-merge-V6_2_1
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch, before we merge the
        V6_2-branch (as tagged at V6_2_1) back in.

7/27/01 V6_2_1
        The 6.2.1 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. 

6/4/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-fixed_varargs
        REMOTE_syscall() has been removed and honest to god senders
        with real function names have been created. This tag also
        includes clipped support for redhat 7.1.  By the way, I can't
        put all the senders in seperate .o files mainly because of
        alias linking where you need to resolve against stuff you
        didn't bring in. So they all must come in.

5/22/01 V6_3-post-authentication
        The V6_3-branch right after zach's authentication stuff.

5/22/01 V6_3-pre-authentication
        The V6_3-branch before zach's authentication stuff, which
        affects pretty much all of condor's ReliSocks.

5/16/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-merge-2
       The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-2.

5/16/01 V6_3_0-merge-2
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch when we again merged it into
        the V6_3-branch for the air force. 

5/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3_0-merge-2
       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-2.

5/1/01 OR 5/3/01(don't know from merge) V6_3-syscall-hack-branch
       New branch for doing massive hacking to the remote syscall
       infrastructure to avoid using va_args, having a giant
       do_remote_syscall() function, etc.  Instead, we'll now generate
       seperate functions for each RSC we're trapping, and ideally, put
       them all in seperate .o files, too.

5/1/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

5/1/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

5/1/01 V6_3_0-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch when we first merged it into
        the V6_3-branch for the new syscall branch and the air force. 

4/20/01 V6_3_0
        The 6.3.0 release, which lives on V6_3_0-branch.

4/19/01  V6_3-pre-kerberos
    A tag VALID ONLY ON SRC that represents the 6_3-branch right before
    Hao checked in his Kerberos stuff. Some files in config/ were checked
    in before this tag was added. (site.def - 1.21.8.5 and Project.tmpl 
    1.68.4.11) 

4/18/01 V6_3_0-branch
        A branch off of V6_3 for the 6.3.0 release of Condor.  This is
        to insulate the 6.3.0 release from other changes to the
        repository as we get 6.3.0 ready to ship.  Hopefully, this
        branch will be abandonded once 6.3.0 is out and any changes
        have been merged back into V6_3-branch.  However, we might
        have to release a 6.3.1 from this branch, as well, depending
        on how things go in the V6_3-branch, and how stable it is
        whenever we need to release 6.3.1.

4/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-4
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the
        still-slightly- post-6.2.0 V6_2 branch in preparation for
        releasing 6.3.0.  (Phew.)

4/16/01 V6_2-merge-4
        V6_2 branch state, still slightly post 6.2.0.  Used for
        merging into the V6_3 branch, in preparation for releasing
        6.3.0.

4/9/01 V6_3-umn-branch  (take two)
        This is a new branch (with the same name) for UMN folks who
        want to hack DAGMan.  Since the old umn branch was created
        before the big CEDAR cleanup in CVS, and since we didn't want
        any trouble with that down the road, we wanted to make a new
        branch for them before they started their work.  Since nothing
        had been checked in to the new branch, we could safely delete
        the old branch tag (which I did in both the V6_3-branch and in
        the V6_3-bandwidth-branch to make sure we removed that tag
        from all files, even ones that had been deleted on the main
        V6_3-branch), and re-tag with the same name, creating a new
        branch.

4/3/01 V6_3-bandwidth-branch
        A new branch off of V6_3 for all the bandwidth control stuff.
        This branch contains modifications to condor_io and
        condor_includes.

4/3/01 V6_3-pre-bandwidth-branch-fix
        The state of the V6_3-branch before I started doing all the
        trickery to create the V6_3-bandwidth-branch, just in case we
        need to back out of any mistakes I might make.  -Derek Wright

3/30/01 V6_3-condor-g-release-2
        The release tag for the second CondorG client-distro. This
        release is from the mainline V6_3-branch, and not the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch, which is now abandoned.

3/29/01 V6_3-umn-branch
        New branch off of V6_3-branch for UMN folks who want to hack
        DAGMan.

3/29/01 V6_3-branch-post-merge-V6_3-condor-g-release-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch as tagged at V6_3-condor-g-release-1.

3/29/01 V6_3-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-condor-g-release-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch as tagged at V6_3-condor-g-release-1.

3/29/01 V6_3-condor-g-release-1
        The state of the CondorG branch for the first client-side
        release. It lives on the V6_3-condor-g-branch

        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging the V6_2 branch as
        tagged at V6_2-merge-3

3/28/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-3
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the V6_2 branch

3/28/01 V6_2-merge-3
        V6_2-branch state, slightly post 6.2.0. Used for the merge
        into 6.3 at the end of March (right around the CondorG merge
        back in, and the split-off of the Minnesota DAGMan branch)

3/15/01 V6_2_0 
        6.2.0 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The date
        on this release is probably bogus, since I forgot to add it to
        this file til well after the fact.

3/6/01  V6_3-galileo-1
        This is a tag of the V6_3 branch for the purposes of giving
        a company called Galileo some experimental/new features 
        concerning job suspension and control from the shadow side.

2/28/01 V6_3-condor-g-branch
        A branch for Condor-G development in anticipation of a release
        in the near future.  Branched from the end of the V6_3-branch
        at 5:45pm on 2/28/01.  Only Condor-G development should go on
        on this branch, and it should be merged back into the regular
        V6_3-branch at the appropriate time.

2/9/01  V6_1_17
        6.1.17 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The good
        lord willing this will be the last 6.1

12/22/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-2
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-2.

12/22/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-2
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-2.

12/22/00 V6_2-merge-2
        V6_2 branch state (still prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

12/6/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

12/6/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

12/6/00 V6_2-merge-1
        V6_2 branch state (just prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

9/14/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_1_16
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/13/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_1_16
        The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
        as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/8?/00 V6_1_16
        6.1.16 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.  config
        was tagged on 9/12, with the code from the earlier date.
        NTconfig and doc were tagged on 9/13/00 with the tail of the
        branch (since I don't think NTconfig changed, doc didn't
        change much, and it doesn't matter nearly as much) There are
        now a bunch more module names and renewed awareness of using
        the *_ALL module names to help avoid these sorts of things in
        the future.  -Derek

8/22/00 V6_1_15
        6.1.15 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.

7/6/00 V6_3-branch
        The branch for all of Condor version 6.3.X (and, probably,
        6.4.X).  Changes made on the V6_2-branch should always be
        merged into this branch, not the trunk.  This branch should be
        merged into the trunk periodically.  6.3.X should contain new
        features, Globus universe stuff, Condor-G, Personal Condor
        stuff, etc.  It should *NOT* contain new classads, new schedd,
        etc, etc. 

7/6/00 V6_2-branch The branch for all of Condor version 6.2.X.  In
        addition, the last few 6.1.X releases (hopefully, just
        6.1.15), will live on this branch.  config, src, doc, and
        NTconfig are all branched.  Changes from this branch should
        *NEVER* be merged directly into the trunk.  They *MUST* be
        merged into the V6_3-branch, and then, those changes should be
        merged from the V6_3-branch into the trunk.

7/6/00 trunk-post-merge-V6_1_14
        The state of the trunk aftering merging with V6_1_13-branch as 
        tagged at the V6_1_14 release.

6/13/00 V6_1_NewAds-3-branch
        This branch has been created to merge in trunk changes with
        the obsolescent V6_1-NewAds-2-branch (which is now going to
        be abandoned).

6/7/00 V6_1_13-branch
        Branch for 6.1.13, so the trunk can start to withstand
        checkins slated for 6.1.14.

5/23/00 V6-preSol28-port
        A tag right before we checked in all the stuff for the
        Solaris 2.8 port.

3/15/00 V6_1_12-diff-ckpt-branch
        A branch for Greg Bronner <gbronner> and John Bent <johnbent>
        to work on experimental code to only checkpoint diffs instead
        of the whole memory image.  Branched from the trunk, somewhere
        between 6.1.12 and 6.1.13.

3/6/00 V6_1_12
        The 6.1.12 release tag, which lives on the trunk.

12/23/99 V6_1_11-pre1
        A pre-release of Version 6.1.11.  This state of the trunk was
        released in two ways: 1) A negotitator for IRIX 6.2 was given
        to CORE in response to [condor-support #237] and this is what
        the "6.1.10" glidein tarballs released on 12/23/99 were built
        with. 

11/24/99 V6_1_10
        The 6.1.10 release tag, which lives on the trunk.

11/19/99 V6_1_10-CAE-beta
        A beta version of 6.1.10 that I (Derek) packaged for CAE for
        clipped Solaris 2.7 support.  I didn't release the real 6.1.10
        today because I ran out of time.  I just wanted to tag this in
        case they have problems so we know what code they have.  
         
11/5/99 V6_1_9
        The 6.1.9 release tag, which lives on the trunk.

10/20/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_8-ntpreview

        tagged at V6_1_8-ntpreview.

10/20/99 V6_1_8-ntpreview-branch
        This is branch used to build the first NT release, 
        Condor NT Preivew v6.1.8.  

8/26/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1-linux-1-branch-merge-1
        The state of the trunk before merging with V6_1-linux-1-branch as
        tagged at V6_1-linux-1-branch-merge-1.

        Compiled only for sparc solaris 551 and given to them in binary form.

6/7/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1
        Tag of Trunk before merging Irix branch back in

6/7/99 V6_1-Irix65-1-branch-merge-1
        Tag of Irix branch before merging

5/28/99 V6_1_6-branch
        Branch for the 6.1.6 release.

4/27/99 V6_1-Irix65-1-branch

4/20/99 V6_1_5-pre-merge-V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This impressively-named tag is of the trunk, right
        before the merge of the unix-dc-pm branch.

4/20/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
        This tag is made on the unix-dc-pm branch before that
        branch's merge back into the trunk.  Hopefully
        we won't ever have to worry about this tag ever again.  :-)
        WANT_DC_PM is turned on in the master and schedd, 
        Create_Process is used, and the schedd's "Agent" is gone.

4/15/99 V6_1_5
        The 6.1.5 release.  Lots of new features, including Condor for
        machines w/ multiple network interfaces, the new Daemon
        object, removed some dead APIs in internet.c, converted some
        things to CEDAR that weren't using it, and tons of bug fixes. 

3/16/99 V6_1-NewAds-2-branch
        This is the second branch for the New-Classads/egcs/STL
        conversion process.  We created the new branch, then we will
        merge the V6_1-NewAds-branch directly into this new branch,
        not the trunk.  Eventually, this branch will be merged into
        the trunk once it's at 6.3.X.

3/16/99 V6_1-co-alloc-1-branch
        Branch created for Adiel to use for his changes to the
        negotiator to support co-allocation of licences w/ machines
        (primarily for CORE).

3/16/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch
        Branch to get DaemonCore (DC) Process Management (PM) working
        on Unix before it gets merged into the trunk.  This will
        hopefully be done quickly and merged back in before we move to
        V6_2.  After this branch was created, the initial check-ins to
        enable Unix DCPM to the schedd were undone on the trunk, since
        they were creating too many problems.

3/11/99 son-of-vics-branch
        New branch for Vic Zandy to do his process hijacking work on.
        The vics-branch was abandonded since there were so many
        changes on the trunk that it would be hell to merge back in. 

3/11/99 new-syscall-branch
        New branch for Doug Thain's re-do of remote syscalls, file
        table stuff, buffering, etc. 

3/9/99  V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_4
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_3-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_3 and V6_1_4.  We're merging from where V6_1_4 is
        tagged. 

3/3/99  V6_1_4
        Version 6.1.4, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Almost
        exclusively bug fixes to V6_1_3, including the fix to the
        fatal FPE exception caused by uninitialized memory in Cedar. 

2/26/99 V6_1_3
        Version 6.1.3, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Lots of SMP bug
        fixes, but lots of other new, unstable features.

2/?/99  V6_1_3-branch
        Branch to get 6.1.3 ready for release.

1/13/99 V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_2
        The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_1-branch, which contains
        both V6_1_1 and V6_1_2.  We're merging from where V6_1_2 is
        tagged. 

1/12/99 V6_1_2
        Most directories are tagged on the V6_1_1-branch, with some
        bug fixes and improvements after the V6_1_1 release was
        tagged.  However, V6_1_2 includes the trunk versions of
        condor_dagman and the pvm directories:
        condor_(shadow|starter).jim.  

?/?/98 V6_1_1
        Version 6.1.1, tagged on the V6_1_1 branch.

12/21/98 V6_1_1-branch
        Branch for the V6_1_1 development series release.  Only src is
        tagged, not config.

?/?/98 V6_1-NewAds-branch

12/9/98 V6_1_0
