01/11/94	Sparc_Sunos4_1:A
	Installed on both instructional and research suns.  Purpose to fix
	bug caused by calling popen() to run "fs" command when reserving
	file space for the AFS cache.  Replaced popen() with my_popen()
	which is more careful to only reap the one child process it starts,
	and to eat up one instance of SIGCHLD for the child it starts.
