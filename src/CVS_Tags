8/10/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-done
		I finished the port a while ago, but here is a tag specifying the
		set of files where I considered the port to be finished.

6/4/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch-fixed_varargs
		REMOTE_syscall() has been removed and honest to god
		senders with real function names have been created. This
		tag also includes clipped support for redhat 7.1.
		By the way, I can't put all the senders in seperate .o
		files mainly because of alias linking where you need to
		resolve against stuff you didn't bring in. So they all
		must come in.

5/1/01 V6_3-syscall-hack-branch
       New branch for doing massive hacking to the remote syscall
       infrastructure to avoid using va_args, having a giant
       do_remote_syscall() function, etc.  Instead, we'll now generate
       seperate functions for each RSC we're trapping, and ideally, put
       them all in seperate .o files, too.

5/1/01 V6_3-post-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

5/1/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_3_0-merge-1
       The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the
       V6_3_0-branch as tagged at V6_3_0-merge-1.

5/1/01 V6_3_0-merge-1
        The state of the V6_3_0-branch when we first merged it into
        the V6_3-branch for the new syscall branch and the air force. 

4/20/01 V6_3_0
	The 6.3.0 release, which lives on V6_3_0-branch.

4/19/01  V6_3-pre-kerberos
    A tag VALID ONLY ON SRC that represents the 6_3-branch right before
    Hao checked in his Kerberos stuff. Some files in config/ were checked
    in before this tag was added. (site.def - 1.21.8.5 and Project.tmpl 
    1.68.4.11) 

4/18/01 V6_3_0-branch
	A branch off of V6_3 for the 6.3.0 release of Condor.  This is
	to insulate the 6.3.0 release from other changes to the
	repository as we get 6.3.0 ready to ship.  Hopefully, this
	branch will be abandonded once 6.3.0 is out and any changes
	have been merged back into V6_3-branch.  However, we might
	have to release a 6.3.1 from this branch, as well, depending
	on how things go in the V6_3-branch, and how stable it is
	whenever we need to release 6.3.1.

4/16/01 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-4
	The state of the V6_3-branch before merging the
	still-slightly- post-6.2.0 V6_2 branch in preparation for
	releasing 6.3.0.  (Phew.)

4/16/01 V6_2-merge-4
        V6_2 branch state, still slightly post 6.2.0.  Used for
        merging into the V6_3 branch, in preparation for releasing
        6.3.0.

4/9/01 V6_3-umn-branch  (take two)
        This is a new branch (with the same name) for UMN folks who
	want to hack DAGMan.  Since the old umn branch was created
	before the big CEDAR cleanup in CVS, and since we didn't want
	any trouble with that down the road, we wanted to make a new
	branch for them before they started their work.  Since nothing
	had been checked in to the new branch, we could safely delete
	the old branch tag (which I did in both the V6_3-branch and in
	the V6_3-bandwidth-branch to make sure we removed that tag
	from all files, even ones that had been deleted on the main
	V6_3-branch), and re-tag with the same name, creating a new
	branch.

4/3/01 V6_3-bandwidth-branch
        A new branch off of V6_3 for all the bandwidth control stuff.
        This branch contains modifications to condor_io and
        condor_includes.

4/3/01 V6_3-pre-bandwidth-branch-fix
        The state of the V6_3-branch before I started doing all the
        trickery to create the V6_3-bandwidth-branch, just in case we
        need to back out of any mistakes I might make.  -Derek Wright

3/30/01 V6_3-condor-g-release-2
        The release tag for the second CondorG client-distro. This
        release is from the mainline V6_3-branch, and not the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch, which is now abandoned.

3/29/01 V6_3-umn-branch
        New branch off of V6_3-branch for UMN folks who want to hack
        DAGMan.

3/29/01 V6_3-branch-post-merge-V6_3-condor-g-release-1
        The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the
        V6_3-condor-g-branch as tagged at V6_3-condor-g-release-1.

3/29/01 V6_3-branch-pre-merge-V6_3-condor-g-release-1

        The state of the CondorG branch for the first client-side

	tagged at V6_2-merge-3

3/28/01 V6_2-merge-3
        V6_2-branch state, slightly post 6.2.0. Used for the merge
        into 6.3 at the end of March (right around the CondorG merge
        back in, and the split-off of the Minnesota DAGMan branch)

3/15/01 V6_2_0 
	6.2.0 release tags, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The date
        on this release is probably bogus, since I forgot to add it to
        this file til well after the fact.

3/6/01  V6_3-galileo-1
	This is a tag of the V6_3 branch for the purposes of giving
	a company called Galileo some experimental/new features 
	concerning job suspension and control from the shadow side.

2/28/01 V6_3-condor-g-branch
	A branch for Condor-G development in anticipation of a release
	in the near future.  Branched from the end of the V6_3-branch
	at 5:45pm on 2/28/01.  Only Condor-G development should go on
	on this branch, and it should be merged back into the regular
	V6_3-branch at the appropriate time.

2/9/01  V6_1_17
	6.1.17 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch. The good
	lord willing this will be the last 6.1

12/22/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-2
	The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
	as tagged at V6_2-merge-2.

	The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
	as tagged at V6_2-merge-2.

12/22/00 V6_2-merge-2
	V6_2 branch state (still prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

12/6/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_2-merge-1
	The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
	as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

12/6/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_2-merge-1
	The state of the V6_3-branch before merging in the V6_2-branch
	as tagged at V6_2-merge-1.

12/6/00 V6_2-merge-1
	V6_2 branch state (just prior to 6.1.17, so not quite worthy
        of the V6_1_17 tag) for merging into V6_3 branch

9/14/00 V6_3-post-merge-V6_1_16
	The state of the V6_3-branch after merging in the V6_2-branch
	as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/13/00 V6_3-pre-merge-V6_1_16

	as tagged at V6_1_16.

9/8?/00 V6_1_16
	6.1.16 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.  config
	was tagged on 9/12, with the code from the earlier date.
	NTconfig and doc were tagged on 9/13/00 with the tail of the
	branch (since I don't think NTconfig changed, doc didn't
	change much, and it doesn't matter nearly as much) There are
	now a bunch more module names and renewed awareness of using
	the *_ALL module names to help avoid these sorts of things in
	the future.  -Derek

8/22/00 V6_1_15
	6.1.15 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.

7/6/00 V6_3-branch
	The branch for all of Condor version 6.3.X (and, probably,
	6.4.X).  Changes made on the V6_2-branch should always be
	merged into this branch, not the trunk.  This branch should be
	merged into the trunk periodically.  6.3.X should contain new
	features, Globus universe stuff, Condor-G, Personal Condor
	stuff, etc.  It should *NOT* contain new classads, new schedd,
	etc, etc. 

7/6/00 V6_2-branch The branch for all of Condor version 6.2.X.  In
	addition, the last few 6.1.X releases (hopefully, just
	6.1.15), will live on this branch.  config, src, doc, and
	NTconfig are all branched.  Changes from this branch should
	*NEVER* be merged directly into the trunk.  They *MUST* be
	merged into the V6_3-branch, and then, those changes should be
	merged from the V6_3-branch into the trunk.

7/6/00 trunk-post-merge-V6_1_14
	The state of the trunk aftering merging with V6_1_13-branch as 
	tagged at the V6_1_14 release.

	6.1.14 release tag, which lives on the V6_1_13-branch.

6/21/00 V6_1_13
	6.1.13 release tag, which lives on the V6_1_13-branch .     

6/13/00 V6_1_NewAds-3-branch
	This branch has been created to merge in trunk changes with
	the obsolescent V6_1-NewAds-2-branch (which is now going to
	be abandoned).

6/7/00 V6_1_13-branch
	Branch for 6.1.13, so the trunk can start to withstand
	checkins slated for 6.1.14.

	released in two ways: 1) A negotitator for IRIX 6.2 was given
	to CORE in response to [condor-support #237] and this is what
	the "6.1.10" glidein tarballs released on 12/23/99 were built
	with. 

11/24/99 V6_1_10
	The 6.1.10 release tag, which lives on the trunk.
	 
11/19/99 V6_1_10-CAE-beta
        A beta version of 6.1.10 that I (Derek) packaged for CAE for
        clipped Solaris 2.7 support.  I didn't release the real 6.1.10
        today because I ran out of time.  I just wanted to tag this in
        case they have problems so we know what code they have.

	This impressively-named tag is of the trunk, right
	before the merge of the unix-dc-pm branch.

4/20/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch-merge-1
	This tag is made on the unix-dc-pm branch before that
	branch's merge back into the trunk.  Hopefully
	we won't ever have to worry about this tag ever again.  :-)
	WANT_DC_PM is turned on in the master and schedd, 
	Create_Process is used, and the schedd's "Agent" is gone.

4/15/99 V6_1_5
	The 6.1.5 release.  Lots of new features, including Condor for
	machines w/ multiple network interfaces, the new Daemon
	object, removed some dead APIs in internet.c, converted some
	things to CEDAR that weren't using it, and tons of bug fixes. 

3/16/99 V6_1-NewAds-2-branch
	This is the second branch for the New-Classads/egcs/STL
	conversion process.  We created the new branch, then we will
	merge the V6_1-NewAds-branch directly into this new branch,
	not the trunk.  Eventually, this branch will be merged into
	the trunk once it's at 6.3.X.

3/16/99 V6_1-co-alloc-1-branch
	Branch created for Adiel to use for his changes to the
	negotiator to support co-allocation of licences w/ machines
	(primarily for CORE).

3/16/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch
	Branch to get DaemonCore (DC) Process Management (PM) working
	on Unix before it gets merged into the trunk.  This will
	hopefully be done quickly and merged back in before we move to
	V6_2.  After this branch was created, the initial check-ins to
	enable Unix DCPM to the schedd were undone on the trunk, since
	they were creating too many problems.

3/11/99 son-of-vics-branch
	New branch for Vic Zandy to do his process hijacking work on.
	The vics-branch was abandonded since there were so many
	changes on the trunk that it would be hell to merge back in. 

3/11/99 new-syscall-branch
	New branch for Doug Thain's re-do of remote syscalls, file
	table stuff, buffering, etc. 

3/9/99	V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_4

	Version 6.1.4, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Almost
	exclusively bug fixes to V6_1_3, including the fix to the
	fatal FPE exception caused by uninitialized memory in Cedar. 

2/26/99	V6_1_3
	Version 6.1.3, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Lots of SMP bug
	fixes, but lots of other new, unstable features.

	tagged. 

1/12/99 V6_1_2
	Most directories are tagged on the V6_1_1-branch, with some
	bug fixes and improvements after the V6_1_1 release was
	tagged.  However, V6_1_2 includes the trunk versions of
	condor_dagman and the pvm directories:
	condor_(shadow|starter).jim.  

?/?/98	V6_1_1
	Version 6.1.1, tagged on the V6_1_1 branch.

12/21/98 V6_1_1-branch
