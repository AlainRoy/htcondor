3/16/99 V6_3-NewAds-1-branch
	This is a new branch for the New-Classads/egcs/STL conversion
	process.  We created the branch, then we will merge the
	V6_1-NewAds-branch directly into this new branch, not the
	trunk.  Eventually, this branch will be merged into the trunk
	once it's at 6.3.X.

3/16/99 co-alloc-1-branch
	Branch created for Adiel to use for his changes to the
	negotiator to support co-allocation of licences w/ machines
	(primarily for CORE).

3/16/99 V6_1-unix-dc-pm-1-branch
	Branch to get DaemonCore (DC) Process Management (PM) working
	on Unix before it gets merged into the trunk.  This will
	hopefully be done quickly and merged back in before we move to
	V6_2.  After this branch was created, the initial check-ins to
	enable Unix DCPM to the schedd were undone on the trunk, since
	they were creating too many problems.

3/11/99 son-of-vics-branch
	New branch for Vic Zandy to do his process hijacking work on.
	The vics-branch was abandonded since there were so many
	changes on the trunk that it would be hell to merge back in. 

3/11/99 new-syscall-branch
	New branch for Doug Thain's re-do of remote syscalls, file
	table stuff, buffering, etc. 

3/9/99	V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_4
	The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_3-branch, which contains
	both V6_1_3 and V6_1_4.  We're merging from where V6_1_4 is
	tagged. 

3/3/99	V6_1_4
	Version 6.1.4, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Almost
	exclusively bug fixes to V6_1_3, including the fix to the
	fatal FPE exception caused by uninitialized memory in Cedar. 

2/26/99	V6_1_3
	Version 6.1.3, tagged on the V6_1_3-branch.  Lots of SMP bug
	fixes, but lots of other new, unstable features.

2/?/99	V6_1_3-branch
	Branch to get 6.1.3 ready for release.

1/13/99	V6_1-pre-merge-V6_1_2
	The trunk, before merging in the V6_1_1-branch, which contains
	both V6_1_1 and V6_1_2.  We're merging from where V6_1_2 is
	tagged. 

1/12/99 V6_1_2
	Most directories are tagged on the V6_1_1-branch, with some
	bug fixes and improvements after the V6_1_1 release was
	tagged.  However, V6_1_2 includes the trunk versions of
	condor_dagman and the pvm directories:
	condor_(shadow|starter).jim.  

?/?/98	V6_1_1
	Version 6.1.1, tagged on the V6_1_1 branch.

12/21/98 V6_1_1-branch
	Branch for the V6_1_1 development series release.  Only src is
	tagged, not config.

?/?/98	V6_1-NewAds-branch

12/9/98	V6_1_0
