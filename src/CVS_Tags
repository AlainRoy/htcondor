12/03/93	Preliminary_CVS:A
	Installed on Ultrix 4.2 non AFS DecStations
01/06/94	Preliminary_Ultrix4_3a:A
	Installed on Ultrix 4.3a with AFS DecStations - does not support
	checkpointing or access to files within the AFS file tree.
01/10/94	Sparc_Sunos4_1:A
	Installed on both instructional and research suns.
01/11/94	Sparc_Sunos4_1:A
	Installed on both instructional and research suns.  Purpose to fix
	bug caused by calling popen() to run "fs" command when reserving
	file space for the AFS cache.  Replaced popen() with my_popen()
	which is more careful to only reap the one child process it starts,
	and to eat up one instance of SIGCHLD for the child it starts.
01/17/94	Jan_17_94
	Fixed memory leaks in condor_startd using purify.  Installed
	only condor_startd on local MIPS_ULTRIX42 machines.
02/23/94	V3:A
	Applies only to src/condor_ckpt.  The checkpointing code with saving
	and restoring the state of open files.  Only runs on the Alphas,
	but compiles on the R6000's (haven't built a syscall() routine
	for the 6000's yet).  Does not cover memory mapped files.
02/27/94	V4:A
	Applies to src/condor_ckpt src/condor_includes config.
	The checkpointing code with saving and restoring state of ordinary
	files.  Runs on OSF/1, HP-UX9, Ultrix4.2a, Ultrix 4.3a, SunOs 4.1.3
	and compiles on Aix 3.2.  Haven't tried to get to run on AIX yet
	because I need to build a syscall() routine there.
