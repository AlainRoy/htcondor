	This is the child class of JICLocal (and therefore

	getting the job ClassAd info from both a file and out of the
	config file.  There are two constructors, one where we take
	another string, one where we don't.  The string is the optional
	keyword we got passed on the command line to prepend to all the
	attributes we want to look up which aren't in the classad that's
	written to the file.  If there's no keyword, either the job
	ClassAd in the file should have all the attributes we need, or it
	should define the keyword itself.
