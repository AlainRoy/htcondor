/* This file is a small hack that allows condor to intercept a call to
   rsh made by the p4 subsystem of MPICH.  The idea is that we name the 
   executable "rsh" and place it ahead of the normal rsh in the PATH.  
   This is done in MPIMasterProc::alterEnv().  Our job here is to 
   intercept the arguments and report them back to the shadow.  We do
   this by getting the shadow's sinful string from the environment
   (placed there by the master) and then sending the command 
   MPI_START_COMRADE to it.  We then pass along the arguments that
   this rsh was called with.

   The p4 code which calls the rsh is the following:

   rc = execlp(remote_shell, remote_shell, host, "-l", username, 
               "-n", pgm,  myhost, serv_port_c, am_slave_c, NULL);
