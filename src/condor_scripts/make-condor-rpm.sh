# This script takes a condor distribution .tar.gz file and 
# creates an RPM that will be put into the current directory.
#
# Example:
#   make-condor-rpm.sh condor-6.5.1.tar.gz /tmp [release-number]
#
# Notes:
#  1) This script requires (the new) condor_configure at the root level 
#  (i.e. in place of old condor_install)
#  2) The RPM's install directory is /opt/condor-<version>,
#    e.g. /opt/condor-6.5.1
#  3) Condor .tar.gz file should follow naming convention:
#    condor-<ver>-....tar.gz
#
# TO DO:
#   + Don't require root
#   + Allow release to be set

# Note something important in the spec file below: In the %files

# the permission as they are, and the "root, root" means to make
# the owner and group root. If we don't do this, it will preserve
# the owner, and if you create it as "roy", it will complain if
# user "roy" doesn't exist. Since RPMs have to be installed as 
# root, this is a safe thing to do. Also, when the condor_configure
# script runs during installation, we'll change the ownership
# as best we can--see %install below
