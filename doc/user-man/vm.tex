The \SubmitCmd{vm} universe facilitates a Condor job
that matches and then lands a disk image on an execute machine
within a Condor pool.
This disk image is intended to be a virtual machine.

This section describes this Condor job.
See section~\ref{sec:Config-VMs}
for details of configuration variables.

\subsection{\label{sec:vm-submitfile}The Submit Description File}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Different than all other universe jobs,
the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job specifies a disk image,
not an executable.
Therefore, the submit commands \SubmitCmd{input}, \SubmitCmd{output},
and \SubmitCmd{error} do not apply.
If specified, \Condor{submit} rejects the job with an error.
The \SubmitCmd{executable} command changes definition within a
\SubmitCmd{vm} universe job.
It no longer specifies an executable file, but instead
provides a string that identifies the job for tools such
as \Condor{q}.

Use of the \SubmitCmd{args} command creates a file named \File{condor.arg},
which is added to the set of CD-ROM files.
The contents of this file are the arguments specified.

VMware and Xen virtual machine software are supported.
As the two differ from each other, the submit description file
specifies either
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_type = vmware
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_type = xen
\end{verbatim}

The job specifies its memory needs 
for the disk image with \SubmitCmd{vm\_memory},
which is given in Mbytes.
Condor uses this number to assure a match with a machine
that can provide the needed memory space.

A CD-ROM for the virtual machine is composed of a set of files.
These files are specified in the submit description file
with a comma-separated list of file names.
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_cdrom_files = a.txt,b.txt,c.txt
\end{verbatim}
Condor must also be told to transfer these files from
the submit machine to the machine that will run the
\SubmitCmd{vm} universe job with 
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_should_transfer_cdrom_files = YES
\end{verbatim}

Creating a checkpoint is straightforward for a virtual machine,
as a checkpoint is a set of files that represent
a snapshot of both disk image and memory.
The checkpoint is created and all files are transferred back
to the \MacroUNI{SPOOL} directory on the machine from which
the job was submitted.
\SubmitCmd{vm} universe jobs can not use a checkpoint server.
The submit command to create checkpoints is
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_checkpoint = true
\end{verbatim}
Without this command, no checkpoints are created (by default).

Virtual machine networking is enabled with the command
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_networking = true
\end{verbatim}
And, when networking is enabled, a definition of
\SubmitCmd{vm\_networking\_type} as \SubmitCmd{bridge\_dhcp}
matches the job with a machine that is configured to use
bridge networking.
A definition of
\SubmitCmd{vm\_networking\_type} as \SubmitCmd{nat\_dhcp}
matches the job with a machine that is configured to use
NAT networking.
A definition of
\SubmitCmd{vm\_networking\_type} as \SubmitCmd{dhcp}
matches with a machine
that enables networking, and the choice of bridge or NAT networking
is determined by the machine's configuration.

A current limitation restricts the use of networking to
\SubmitCmd{vm} universe jobs that do not create checkpoints
such that the job may migrate to another machine.

When both checkpoints and networking are enabled,
the job further specifies
\begin{verbatim}
  when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT
\end{verbatim}

Modified disk images are transferred back to the machine from which
the job was submitted as the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job completes.
Job completion for a \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job occurs when 
the virtual machine is shut down, and Condor notices 
(as the result of a periodic check on the state of the virtual machine).
Should the job not want any files transferred back (modified or not),
for example because the job explicitly transferred its own files,
the submit command to prevent the transfer is
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_no_output_vm = true
\end{verbatim}

Further commands specify information that is specific to the
virtual machine type targeted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:vm-VMwaresubmitfile}VMware-Specific Submit Commands}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{vm universe!submit commands specific to VMware}

Specific to VMware, the submit description file command
\SubmitCmd{vmware\_dir} gives the path and directory
(on the machine from which the job is submitted)
where VMware-specific files and applications reside.
Examples of these VMware-specific applications are VMDK and VMX.

Condor must be told whether or not the contents of the \SubmitCmd{vmware\_dir}
directory must be transferred to the machine where the job is
to be executed.
This required information is given with the submit command
\SubmitCmd{vmware\_should\_transfer\_files}.
With a value of \Expr{True},
Condor does transfer the contents of the directory.
With a value of \Expr{False},
Condor does not transfer the contents of the directory,
and instead presumes that access to this directory is
available through a shared file system.

By default, Condor uses a snapshot disk for new and modified files.
They may also be utilized for checkpoints.
The snapshot disk is initially quite small,
growing only as new files are created or files are modified.
When \SubmitCmd{vmware\_should\_transfer\_files} is \Expr{True},
a job may specify that a snapshot disk is \emph{not} to be
used with the command
\begin{verbatim}
  vmware_snapshot_disk = False
\end{verbatim}
In this case, Condor will utilize original disk files in producing
checkpoints. 
Note that \Condor{submit} issues an error message and does not
submit the job if both \SubmitCmd{vmware\_should\_transfer\_files}
and \SubmitCmd{vmware\_snapshot\_disk} are \Expr{False}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:vm-Xensubmitfile}Xen-Specific Submit Commands}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{vm universe!submit commands specific to VMware}

The required disk image must be identified for a Xen virtual machine.
This \SubmitCmd{xen\_disk} command specifies a list of comma-separated files.
Each disk file is specified by 3 colon separated fields.
The first field is the path and file name of the disk file.
The second field specifies the device,
and the third field specifies permissions.
Here is an example that identifies two files:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  xen_disk = /myxen/diskfile.img:sda1:w,/myxen/swap.img:sda2:w
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If any files need to be transferred from the submit machine
to the machine where the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job will execute, 
Condor must be explicitly told to do so with the 
\SubmitCmd{xen\_transfer\_files} command:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  xen_transfer_files = /myxen/diskfile.img,/myxen/swap.img
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Any and all needed files on a system without a shared file
system (between the submit machine and the machine where the
job will execute) must be listed.

% xen_kernel description
A Xen \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job requires specification of the
guest kernel. 
The \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel} command accomplishes this, 
utilizing one of the following definitions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = any}
  tells Condor that the kernel is pre-staged, and its location is
  specified by configuration of the \Condor{vm-gahp}.

\item \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = included} implies that the kernel
  is to be found in disk image given by the definition of the single file
  specified in \SubmitCmd{xen\_disk}. 

% \item \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = vmx} implies that the kernel
%  is to be found in disk image given by the definition of the single file
%  specified in \SubmitCmd{xen\_disk}.  This is the same assumption
%  as in \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = included}.

%  \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = vmx} further implies that the job must be
%  matched with a machine that supports hardware virtualization. 
%  Such a machine would be configured with \Expr{VM\_HARDWARE\_VT = True}.

\item \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel = path-to-kernel} gives a full path and
  file name of the required kernel.  If this kernel must be transferred
  to machine on which the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job will execute,
  it must also be included in the \SubmitCmd{xen\_transfer\_files} command. 

  This form of the \SubmitCmd{xen\_kernel} command also requires further
  definition of the \SubmitCmd{xen\_root} command.
  \SubmitCmd{xen\_root} defines the device containing files needed by
  \Login{root}.

\end{enumerate}

Transfer of CD-ROM files under Xen requires the definition of
the associated device in addition to the specification of the
files.
The submit description file contains
\begin{verbatim}
  vm_cdrom_files = a.txt,b.txt,c.txt
  vm_should_transfer_cdrom_files = YES
  xen_cdrom_device = device-name
\end{verbatim}
where the last line of this example defines the device.

\subsection{\label{sec:vm-job-completion-details}Job Completion in the vm Universe}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Job completion for a \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job occurs when 
the virtual machine is shut down, and Condor notices 
(as the result of a periodic check on the state of the virtual machine).
This is different from jobs executed under the environment of other 
universes.

Shut down of a virtual machine occurs from within the virtual
machine environment.
Under a Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Vista virtual machine,
an administrator issues the command
\begin{verbatim}
  shutdown -s -t 01
\end{verbatim}
For older versions of Windows operating systems, 
directions are given at
\URL{http://www.aumha.org/win4/a/shutcut.php}.

Under a Linux virtual machine,
the \Login{root} user executes
\begin{verbatim}
  /sbin/poweroff
\end{verbatim}
The command \verb@/sbin/halt@ will not completely
shut down some Linux distributions, and instead
causes the job to hang.

Since the successful completion of the \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job
requires the successful shut down of the virtual machine,
it is good advice to try the shut down procedure outside of
Condor, before a \SubmitCmd{vm} universe job is submitted.
