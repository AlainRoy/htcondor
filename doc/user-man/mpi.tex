\index{MPI|(}
MPI stands for Message Passing Interface.
It provides an environment under which parallel programs
may synchronize, 
by providing communication support.
Running the MPI-based parallel programs within Condor 
eases the programmer's effort.
Condor dedicates machines for running the programs,
and it does so using the same interface used when submitting
non-MPI jobs.

Condor currently supports MPICH version ch\_p4, the implementation
offered by Argonne National Labs.
This version is available without charge by download.
See the web page at
\URL{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/}
for details and availability.
Programs to be submitted for execution under Condor will have
been compiled using \Prog{mpicc}.
No further compilation or linking is necessary to run jobs
under Condor.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:MPI-setup}MPI Details of Set Up}

Administratively, Condor must be configured such that resources
(machines) running MPI jobs are dedicated.
\index{scheduling!dedicated}
Dedicated machines are ones that, once they begin execution of
a program, will continue executing the program until
the program ends.
The program will not be preempted (to run another program) or
suspended.
Since Condor is not ordinarily used in this manner (Condor uses
opportunistic scheduling),
machines that are to be used as dedicated resources
must be configured as such.
Section~\ref{sec:Config-Dedicated-Jobs} of
Administrator's Manual describes the necessary
configuration and provides detailed examples.

To simplify the dedicated scheduling of resources,
a single machine becomes the scheduler of dedicated resources.
This leads to a further restriction that jobs submitted
to execute under the MPI universe (with dedicated machines)
must be
submitted from the machine running as the dedicated scheduler.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:MPI-submit}MPI Job Submission}

Once the programs are written and compiled, and Condor resources
are correctly configured, jobs may be submitted.
Each Condor job requires a submit description file.
The simplest submit description file for an MPI job:

\begin{verbatim}
#############################################
##   submit description file for mpi_program
#############################################
universe = MPI
executable = mpi_program
machine_count = 4
queue 
\end{verbatim}

This job specifies the \Attr{universe} as \Attr{mpi},
letting Condor know that dedicated resources will be required.
The \Attr{machine\_count} command identifies the number
of machines required by the job.
The four machines that run the program will default to
be of the same architecture
and operating system as the machine on which the job is submitted,
since a platform is not specified as a requirement.

The simplest example does not specify an input or output,
meaning that the computation completed is useless,
since both input comes from and the output goes to \File{/dev/null}.
A more complex example of a submit description file
utilizes other features.
\begin{verbatim}
######################################
## MPI example submit description file
######################################
universe = MPI
executable = simplempi
log = logfile
input = infile.$(NODE)
output = outfile.$(NODE)
error = errfile.$(NODE)
machine_count = 4
queue
\end{verbatim}

The specification of the input, output, and error files
utilize a predefined macro that is only relevant to
mpi universe jobs.
\index{macro!predefined}
See the \Condor{submit} manual page on
page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} 
for further description of predefined macros.
The \MacroU{NODE} macro is given a unique value as
programs are assigned to machines.
This value is what the MPICH version ch\_p4 implementation
terms the rank of a program.
Note that this term is unrelated and independent of the
Condor term rank.
The \MacroUNI{NODE} value is fixed for the entire length
of the job.
It can therefore be used to identify individual aspects
of the computation.
In this example, it is used to give unique names to input
and output files.

If your site does NOT have a shared filesystem across all the nodes
where your MPI computation will execute, you can use Condor's file
transfer mechanism.
You can find out more details about these settings by reading the
\Condor{submit} man page or section~\ref{sec:file-transfer} on
page~\pageref{sec:file-transfer}. 
Assuming your job only reads input from STDIN, here is an example
submit file for a site without a shared filesystem:

\begin{verbatim}
######################################
## MPI example submit description file
## without using a shared filesystem
######################################
universe = MPI
executable = simplempi
log = logfile
input = infile.$(NODE)
output = outfile.$(NODE)
error = errfile.$(NODE)
machine_count = 4
should_transfer_files = yes
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
queue
\end{verbatim}

Consider the following C program that uses this example submit
description file.

\begin{verbatim}
/**************
 * simplempi.c
 **************/
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mpi.h"

int main(argc,argv)
    int argc;
    char *argv[];
{
    int myid;
    char line[128];

    MPI_Init(&argc,&argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&myid);

    fprintf ( stdout, "Printing to stdout...%d\n", myid );
    fprintf ( stderr, "Printing to stderr...%d\n", myid );
    fgets ( line, 128, stdin );
    fprintf ( stdout, "From stdin: %s", line );

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

Here is a makefile that works with the example.
It would build the MPI executable, using the MPICH
version ch\_p4 implementation.
\begin{verbatim}
###################################################################
## This is a very basic Makefile                                 ##
###################################################################

# the location of the MPICH compiler
CC          = /usr/local/bin/mpicc
CLINKER     = $(CC)

CFLAGS    = -g
EXECS     = simplempi

all: $(EXECS)

simplempi: simplempi.o
        $(CLINKER) -o simplempi simplempi.o -lm

.c.o:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.c
\end{verbatim}

The submission to Condor requires exactly four machines,
and queues four programs.
Each of these programs requires an input file (correctly
named) and produces an output file.

If input file for \MacroUNI{NODE} = 0 (called \File{infile.0}) contains
\begin{verbatim}
Hello number zero.
\end{verbatim}
and
the input file for \MacroUNI{NODE} = 1 (called \File{infile.1}) contains
\begin{verbatim}
Hello number one.
\end{verbatim}
then after the job is submitted to Condor,
there will be 
eight files created:  
\File{errfile.[0-3]} and \File{outfile.[0-3]}.
\File{outfile.0} will contain
\begin{verbatim}
Printing to stdout...0
From stdin: Hello number zero.
\end{verbatim}
and \File{errfile.0} will contain
\begin{verbatim}
Printing to stderr...0
\end{verbatim}
