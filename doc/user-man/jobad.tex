\index{ClassAd!job attributes}
%
\item[\AdAttr{CkptArch}] : String describing the architecture of the machine
where this job last checkpointed.  If the job has never checkpointed,
this attribute is UNDEFINED.
%
\item[\AdAttr{CkptOpSys}] : String describing the operating system of
the machine where this job last checkpointed.  If the job has never
checkpointed, this attribute is UNDEFINED.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ClusterId}] : Integer cluster identifier for this job.
A ``cluster'' is a group of jobs that were submitted together.  Each
job has its own unique job identifier within the cluser, but shares a
common cluster identifier.
%
\item[\AdAttr{CumulativeSuspensionTime}] : A running total of the number of
seconds the job has spent in suspension for the life of the job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ExecutableSize}] : Size of the executable in kbytes.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ExitBySignal}] : When a user job exits, this is true if the
job exited via a signal, and false otherwise. Currently this is available for use only in Standard and Vanilla universe jobs.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ExitCode}] : When a user job exits by means other than a signal,
this is the exit return code of the user job. Currently this is available for use only in Standard and Vanilla universe jobs.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ExitSignal}] : When a user job exits by means of an unhandled 
signal, this attribute takes on the numeric value of the signal. Currently this is available for use only in Standard and Vanilla universe jobs.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ImageSize}] : Estimate of the memory image size of the
job in kbytes.  The initial estimate may be specified in the job
submit file.  Otherwise, the initial value is equal to the size of the
executable.  When the job checkpoints, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobPrio}] : Integer priority for this job, set by
\Condor{submit} or \Condor{prio}.  The default value is 0.  The higher
the number, the worse the priority.
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobStartDate}] : Time at which the job first began
running.  Measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobStatus}] : Integer which indicates the current
status of the job, where 1 = Idle, 2 = Running, 3 = Removed, 4 =
Completed, and 5 = Held.
%
\item[\AdAttr{JobUniverse}] : Integer which indicates the job
universe, where 1 = Standard, 4 = PVM, 5 = Vanilla, and 7 = Scheduler.
%
\item[\AdAttr{LastCkptServer}] : Hostname of the last checkpoint
server used by this job.  When a pool is using multiple checkpoint
servers, this tells the job where to find its checkpoint file.
%
\item[\AdAttr{LastCkptTime}] : Time at which the job last performed a
successful checkpoint.  Measured in the number of seconds since the
epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[\AdAttr{LastSuspensionTime}] : Time at which the job last performed a
successful suspension.  Measured in the number of seconds since the
epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[\AdAttr{LastVacateTime}] : Time at which the job was last
evicted from a remote workstation.  Measured in the number of seconds
since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
%
\item[\AdAttr{NumCkpts}] : A count of the number of checkpoints
written by this job during its lifetime.
%
\item[\AdAttr{NumRestarts}] : A count of the number of restarts from a
checkpoint attempted by this job during its lifetime.
%
\item[\AdAttr{NiceUser}] : Boolean value which indicates whether
this is a nice-user job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{Owner}] : String describing the user who submitted this
job.
%
\item[\AdAttr{ProcId}] : Integer process identifier for this job.  In
a cluster of many jobs, each job will have the same ClusterId but will
have a unique ProcId.
%
\item[\AdAttr{TotalSuspensions}] : A count of the number of times this job
has been suspended during its lifetime.
%
\item[\AdAttr{QDate}] : Time at which the job was submitted to the job
queue.  Measured in the
number of seconds since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
