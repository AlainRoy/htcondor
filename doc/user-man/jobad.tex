The value changes each time a job or set of jobs are queued for
execution under Condor.

%%% ClassAd attribute: Cmd

epoch time of when the job entered into its current status
So for example, if the job is on hold, the ClassAd expression

when a user job exits via a signal and \Expr{False} otherwise.
It is available for use 
in all universes except the globus universe.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ExitCode
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ExitCode}
\item[\AdAttr{ExitCode}] : When a user job exits by means other than a signal,
this is the exit return code of the user job.

in all universes except the globus universe.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ExitSignal
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ExitSignal}
\item[\AdAttr{ExitSignal}] : When a user job exits by means of an unhandled 
signal, this attribute takes on the numeric value of the signal.
It is available for use 
in all universes except the globus universe.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ExitStatus
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ExitStatus}
\item[\AdAttr{ExitStatus}] : The way that Condor previously dealt with
a job's exit status.
This attribute should no longer be used.
It is not always accurate in
heterogeneous pools, or if the job exited with a signal.
Instead, see the attributes: \AdAttr{ExitBySignal},
\AdAttr{ExitCode}, and
\AdAttr{ExitSignal}.

%%% ClassAd attribute: HoldKillSig
\index{ClassAd job attribute!HoldKillSig}
\item[\AdAttr{HoldKillSig}] :   Currently only for scheduler and local
universe jobs,

%%% ClassAd attribute: HoldReason
\index{ClassAd job attribute!HoldReason}
\item[\AdAttr{HoldReason}] :   A string containing a human-readable
message about why a job is on hold.

the command \verb@condor_q -hold@.
It can be used to determine if a job should be released or not.

%%% ClassAd attribute: ImageSize
\index{ClassAd job attribute!ImageSize}
\item[\AdAttr{ImageSize}] : Estimate of the memory image size of the
job in Kbytes.  The initial estimate may be specified in the job
submit file.  Otherwise, the initial value is equal to the size of the
executable.  When the job checkpoints, the \AdAttr{ImageSize}
attribute is set to the size of the checkpoint file (since the
checkpoint file contains the job's memory image).

internally every 15 seconds.

\index{ClassAd job attribute!NumSystemHolds}
\item[\AdAttr{NumSystemHolds}] :  An integer that is incremented each time
Condor-G places a job on hold due to some sort of error condition.  This
counter is useful, since Condor-G will always place a job on hold when it

The job (process) identifier described here is unrelated to operating
system PIDs.

If \Expr{False}, then
standard error is transfered back to the submit machine
(as a whole) after the job completes.

that is transferred is given by the
job attribute \Attr{Cmd}.
