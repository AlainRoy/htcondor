Submitting jobs to run under the globus universe has not yet
been perfected.
The following is a list of known limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{No checkpoints.}
\item{No matchmaking.}
\item{File transfer is limited.}
There are no file transfer mechanisms for files other
than the executable, \File{stdin}, \File{stdout}, and \File{stderr}.
\item{No job exit codes.}
Job exit codes are not available.
\item{Limited platform availability.}
Condor-G is only available on Linux, Solaris,
Digital UNIX, and IRIX.
HP-UX support will hopefully be available later.
\end{enumerate}
