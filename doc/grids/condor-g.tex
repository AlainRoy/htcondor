Condor-G is a ``window to the grid.''
The function of Condor-G becomes clear
with a brief overview of the software that forms a Condor pool.
For this discussion, the software of a Condor pool is divided
into two parts.
The first part does job management.
It keeps track of a user's jobs.
You can ask the job management part of Condor to show
you the job queue, to submit new jobs to the system,
to put jobs on hold,
and to request information about jobs that have completed.
The other part of the Condor software
does resource management.
It keeps track of which machines are available to run jobs,
how the available machines should be utilized given all the users
who want to run jobs on them,
and when a machine is no longer available.
Condor-G works with grid resources, allowing users to
effectively submit jobs, manage jobs, and have jobs execute
on widely distributed machines.

A machine with the job management part installed
is called a submit machine.
A machine with the resource management part installed 
is called an execute machine.
Each machine may have one part or both.
Condor-G is the job management part of Condor.
\index{Condor-G!functionality}
Condor-G lets you submit jobs into a queue,
have a log detailing the life cycle of your jobs,
manage your input and output files,
along with everything else you expect from a job queuing system.

Condor-G is a program that manages both a queue of jobs
and the resources from one or more sites where those jobs can execute. 
For some of these jobs,
it communicates with these resources and transfers files
to and from these resources using Globus mechanisms.
(In particular, Condor-G uses the GRAM protocol for job submission,
and it runs a local GASS server for file transfers).

\Note This version of the manual has correct installation instructions
for Condor-G \VersionNotice, but other usage information has not
yet been updated.

\subsection{\label{sec:Condor-G-Limits}Limitations of Condor-G}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{Condor-G!limitations}
Submitting jobs to run under the grid universe has not yet
been perfected.
The following is a list of known limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{No checkpoints.}
\item{No job exit codes.}
Job exit codes are not available.
\item{Limited platform availability.}
Condor-G is only available on Linux, Solaris,
Digital UNIX, and IRIX.
HP-UX support will hopefully be available later.
\end{enumerate}
