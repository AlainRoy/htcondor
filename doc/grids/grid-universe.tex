\subsection{Removing Grid Universe jobs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When you remove a job with \Condor{rm}, you may find that the job
enters the ``X'' state for a very long time. This is normal: Condor
is attempting to communicate with the remote scheduling system and
ensure that the job has been properly cleaned up. If it takes too long
or (in rare circumstances) is never removed, you can force the job to
leave the job queue by using the -forcex option to \Condor{rm}. This
will forcibly remove jobs that are in the X state without attempting
to finish any cleanup at the remote scheduler.
