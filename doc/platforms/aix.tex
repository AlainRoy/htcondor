The version of Condor for AIX 5.2L has the same shortcommings as Condor
for the AIX5.1L platform.

In addition the Condor binaries for AIX 5.2L will NOT execute on an
AIX 5.1L machine.

This is a relatively new port of Condor to the AIX architecture and as such
there are a few things that aren't completely finished. Over time, these will
be fixed.

Condor on AIX 5.1L has a few shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keyboard Idle and Mouse Idle is wrong and will be fixed in a future
	release of Condor.
\item The memory size of threaded programs is reported incorrectly.
\item The memory/usage statistics of completed jobs is sometimes wrong.
\item The Standard Universe is not supported.
\end{itemize}

In addition, Condor for the AIX 5.1L machine WILL execute correctly on an
AIX 5.2L machine.
