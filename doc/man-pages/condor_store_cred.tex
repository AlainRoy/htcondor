\Description 

\Condor{store\_cred} stores the password of a user/domain pair
securely in the Windows registry.
Using this stored password,
Condor is able to run jobs with the user ID of the submitting user
when running scheduler universe jobs and DAGMan.
The password is stored
in the same manner as 
the system does when
setting or changing account passwords.

When \Condor{store\_cred} is invoked,
it contacts the \Condor{schedd} daemon to 
carry out the requested operations on behalf of the user.
This is necessary since registry keys
are accessible only by the Windows SYSTEM account, not by administrators
or other users. 

The password is stashed in a persistent manner; it is maintained
across system reboots.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{add}}{Store the current user's password in the
	registry.  The user is prompted to enter the password
	twice for confirmation, and
	characters are not echoed.
	If there is already have a password stashed,
	the old password will be overwritten by the new password.}

	\OptItem{\Opt{delete}}{Delete the current user's
	stashed password, if it exists.}

\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{store\_cred} will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
