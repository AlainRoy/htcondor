\Description 

\Condor{master\_off} shuts down all of the condor daemons running on a given
machine.  It does this cleanly without a loss of work done by any jobs
currently running on this machine, or jobs that are running on other machines
that have been submitted from this machine.  At the end of the shutdown
process, unlike \Condor{off}, \Condor{master\_off} also shuts down the
\Condor{master} daemon.  If you want to turn condor back on on this machine in
the future, you will need to restart the \Condor{master}.
