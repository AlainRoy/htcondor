\Description 

This daemon is responsible for keeping all the
rest of the Condor daemons running on each machine in your pool.  It  
spawns the other daemons, and periodically checks to see if there are
new binaries installed for any of them.  If there are, the master will
restart the affected daemons.  In addition, if any daemon crashes, the
master will send email to the Condor Administrator of your pool and 
restart the daemon.  The \Condor{master} also supports various
administrative commands that let you start, stop or reconfigure
daemons remotely.  The \Condor{master} will run on every machine in 
your Condor pool, regardless of what functions each machine are
performing.

See section~\ref{sec:Condor-Daemons} in Admin Manual for more information
about \Condor{master} and other Condor daemons.
