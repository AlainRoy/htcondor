\Description

\Condor{wait} watches a user log file (created with the \emph{log}
option in the submit file) and returns when a specific job (or all
jobs mentioned in the log) have completed or aborted. 

Because \Condor{wait} expects to find at least a ``job submitted''
event in the log file, the job must have been successfully submitted
with \Condor{submit} before you run \Condor{wait}.

\Condor{wait} will wait forever for a job to finish, unless you
specify a shorter waiting time.

\begin{Options}
    \ToolArgsBaseDesc
    \OptItem{\Opt{-debug}}{Show extra debugging information.}
    \OptItem{\OptArgnm{-wait}{seconds}}{Wait no more than this
    time. The default is unlimited time.} 
    \OptItem{log file}{The log file to watch for information about the
    job.}
    \OptItem{job number}{A specific job to watch. If this option is
    not specified, all jobs that exist in the file when \Condor{wait} is
    invoked will be watched.}

\end{Options}

\GenRem 

\Condor{wait} is an inexpensive way to test or wait for the completion
of a job or a whole cluster, if you are trying to get a process
outside of Condor to synchronize with a job or set of jobs.

\Examples

\Condor{wait} logfile\\*
This command waits for all jobs that exist in ``logfile'' to complete.

\Condor{wait} logfile 40\\*
This command waits for all jobs that exist in ``logfile'' and are part
of cluster 40 to complete.

\Condor{wait} logfile 40.1\\*
This command waits for job 40.1 that exists in ``logfile'' to
complete.

\Condor{wait} -wait 3600 logfile 40.1. This waits for job 40.1 to
complete by watching ``logfile'', but it will not wait more than one
hour (3600 seconds).

\ExitStatus

\Condor{wait} returns exits with 0 if and only if the specified job
(or all jobs, if none were specified) have completed or
aborted. \Condor{wait} returns 1 if unrecoverable errors occur, such
as a missing log file, if the job does not exist in the log file, or
the user-specified waiting time has expired.
