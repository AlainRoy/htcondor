\Description 

\Condor{off} shuts down all of the condor daemons running on a given
machine.  It does this cleanly without a loss of work done by any jobs
currently running on this machine, or jobs that are running on other machines
that have been submitted from this machine.  The only daemon that remains
running is the \Condor{master}, which can handle both local and remote
requests to restart the other condor daeomns if need be.  To restart
condor running on a machine, see the \Condor{on} command.
