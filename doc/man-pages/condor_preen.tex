\Description 

\Condor{preen} examines the directories belonging to Condor, 
and removes extraneous files and directories which may be left over from
Condor processes which terminated abnormally either due to internal errors or
a system crash. The directories checked are the LOG, EXECUTE, and SPOOL
directories as defined in the Condor configuration files. \Condor{preen} is
intended to be run as user root (or user condor) periodically as a backup
method to ensure reasonable file system cleanliness in the face of
errors. This is done automatically by default by the \Condor{master}. 
It may also be explicitly invoked on an as needed basis.

\begin{Options}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-mail}}{Send mail to the CONDOR\_ADMINISTRATORS as
	defined in the Condor configuration files instead of writing to the
	standard output}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-remove}}{Remove the offending files and directories
	rather than just reporting on them}

	\OptItem{\Opt{-verbose}}{List all files found in the Condor
	directories, even those which are not considered extraneous}

\end{Options}
