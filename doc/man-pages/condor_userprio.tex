\Description 
\Condor{userprio} with no arguments, lists the priorities of all
the users that have a priority value larger than the minimum (The minimum
priority value is 0.5, and it corresponds to the highest possible
priority). The -set option is used to change a user's priority, and requires
special privilage.

A user's priority changes according to his usage of resources. The central
manager uses this value during the negotiation phase to decide how many
resources to allocate to each user.

\begin{Options}

\OptItem{\Opt{-res}}{Also display the number of resources used by each
    user. Note that this value reflects the number of resources used at the
    end of the last negotiation cycle.}

\OptItem{\OptArg{-set}{username priority}}
