the \AdAttr{Machine} attribute, but could be customized by the site
administrator.
On SMP machines, the \Condor{startd} will divide the CPUs up into separate
slots, each with with a unique name.
These names will be of the form ``slot\#@full.hostname'', for example,

%
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!TargetType}

In addition, there are a few attributes that are automatically
inserted into the machine ClassAd whenever a resource is in the
Claimed state:

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!ClientMachine}
\item[\AdAttr{ClientMachine}:] The hostname of the machine that has
claimed this resource

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteOwner}:] The name of the user who originally
claimed this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!RemoteUser}
\item[\AdAttr{RemoteUser}:] The name of the user who is currently
using this resource.
In general, this will always be the same as the \AdAttr{RemoteOwner},
but in some cases, a resource can be claimed by one entity that hands
off the resource to another entity which uses it.
In that case, \AdAttr{RemoteUser} would hold the name of the entity
currently using the resource, while \AdAttr{RemoteOwner} would hold
the name of the entity that claimed the resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingOwner}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingOwner}:] The name of the user who is preempting
the job that is currently running on this resource.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingUser}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingUser}:] The name of the user who is preempting
the job that is currently running on this resource.  The relationship
between \AdAttr{PreemptingUser} and \AdAttr{PreemptingOwner} is the same
as the relationship between \AdAttr{RemoteUser} and \AdAttr{RemoteOwner}.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!PreemptingRank}
\item[\AdAttr{PreemptingRank}:] A float which represents this machine
owner's affinity for running the Condor job which is waiting for the
current job to finish or be preempted.  If not currently hosting a
Condor job, \AdAttr{PreemptingRank} is undefined.  When a machine is
claimed and there is already a job running, the attribute's value is
computed by evaluating the machine's \AdAttr{Rank} expression with
respect to the preempting job's ClassAd.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalClaimRunTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalClaimRunTime}:] A running total of the amount of

(have spent in the Claimed/Busy state).


\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalClaimSuspendTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalClaimSuspendTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that all jobs (under the same claim) have been
suspended (in the Claimed/Suspended state).

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalJobRunTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalJobRunTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that a single job ran
(has spent in the Claimed/Busy state).

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (in Claimed State)!TotalJobSuspendTime}
\item[\AdAttr{TotalJobSuspendTime}:] A running total of the amount of
time (in seconds) that a single job has been suspended
(in the Claimed/Suspended state).

\end{description}

There are a few attributes that are only inserted into the
machine ClassAd if a job is currently executing.  
If the resource is claimed but no job are running, none of these
attributes will be defined.

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!JobId}
\item[\AdAttr{JobId}:] The job's identifier (for example,
\verb@152.3@), as seen from \Condor{q}

\item[\AdAttr{JobStart}:] The time stamp in integer seconds of when the job began
executing, since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).  For idle
machines, the value is UNDEFINED.

\index{ClassAd machine attribute (when running)!LastPeriodicCheckpoint}
\item[\AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint}:] If the job has performed a
periodic checkpoint, this attribute will be defined and will hold the
time stamp of when the last periodic checkpoint was begun.
If the job has yet to perform a periodic checkpoint, or cannot
checkpoint at all, the \AdAttr{LastPeriodicCheckpoint} attribute will
not be defined.

\end{description}

Finally, the single attribute, 
\Attr{CurrentTime}, is defined by the ClassAd
environment.
\begin{description}
\index{ClassAd attribute!CurrentTime}
\item[\AdAttr{CurrentTime}:] Evaluates to the 
the number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
