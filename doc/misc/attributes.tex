%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

ClassAd attributes vary, 
depending on the entity producing the ClassAd.
Therefore, each ClassAd has an attribute named \AdAttr{MyType},
which describes the type of ClassAd.
In addition, the \Condor{collector} appends attributes to
any daemon's ClassAd, whenever the \Condor{collector} is
queried. These additional attributes are listed in
the unnumbered subsection labeled ClassAd Attributes Added by the \Condor{collector}
on page~\pageref{sec:Collector-Added-Attributes}.

Here is a list of defined values for \AdAttr{MyType},
as well as a reference to a list attributes relevant to
that type.

\begin{description}
  \item[\AdAttr{Job}]
  Each submitted job describes its state, for use by the
  \Condor{negotiator} daemon in finding a machine upon which to
  run the job.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a job ClassAd are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labeled Job ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Machine}]
   Each machine in the pool (and hence, the \Condor{startd} daemon running
   on that machine) describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a machine ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labeled Machine ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Machine-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{DaemonMaster}]
   Each \Condor{master} daemon describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a DaemonMaster ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labeled DaemonMaster ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:DaemonMaster-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Scheduler}]
   Each \Condor{schedd} daemon describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a Scheduler ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labeled Scheduler ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Scheduler-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Negotiator}]
   Each \Condor{negotiator} daemon describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a Negotiator ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labeled Negotiator ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Negotiator-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Query}]
  \Todo
  % Prose here about a \Attr{Query} value.

\index{ClassAd!attributes added by the \Condor{collector}}

\begin{description}

\index{ClassAd attribute added by the \Condor{collector}!LastHeardFrom}
\item[\AdAttr{LastHeardFrom}:] The time inserted into a daemon's
  ClassAd representing the time that this \Condor{collector}
  last received a message from the daemon.
  Time is  represented as the number of second elapsed since
  the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).

\index{ClassAd attribute added by the \Condor{collector}!UpdatesHistory}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesHistory}:] A bitmap representing the status of
  the most recent updates received from the daemon.

\index{ClassAd attribute added by the \Condor{collector}!UpdatesLost}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesLost}:] An integer count of the number of updates
  from the daemon that were lost since the \Condor{collector} started
  running.

\index{ClassAd attribute added by the \Condor{collector}!UpdatesSequenced}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesSequenced}:] An integer count of the number of updates
  received from the daemon for which the \Condor{collector} can tell
  how many were lost, since the \Condor{collector} started running.

\index{ClassAd attribute added by the \Condor{collector}!UpdatesTotal}
\item[\AdAttr{UpdatesTotal}:] An integer count started when the
  \Condor{collector} started running, representing the sum
  of the number of updates actually received from the daemon plus
  the number of updates that the \Condor{collector} determined were lost.
