ClassAd attributes vary, 
depending on the entity producing the ClassAd.
Therefore, each ClassAd has an attribute named \AdAttr{MyType},
which describes the type of ClassAd.
Here is a list of defined values for \AdAttr{MyType},
as well as a reference to a list attributes relevant to
that type.

\begin{description}
  \item[\AdAttr{Job}]
  Each submitted job describes its state, for use by the
  \Condor{negotiator} daemon in finding a machine upon which to
  run the job.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a job ClassAd are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labelled Job ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Machine}]
   Each machine in the pool (and hence, the \Condor{startd} daemon running
   on that machine) describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a machine ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labelled Machine ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Machine-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{DaemonMaster}]
   Each \Condor{master} daemon describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a DaemonMaster ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labelled DaemonMaster ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:DaemonMaster-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Scheduler}]
   Each \Condor{schedd} daemon describes its state.
  ClassAd attributes that appear in a Scheduler ClassAd 
  are listed and described in
  the unnumbered subsection labelled Scheduler ClassAd Attributes
  on page~\pageref{sec:Scheduler-ClassAd-Attributes}.

  \item[\AdAttr{Negotiator}]
  \Todo
  % Prose here about a \Attr{Negotiator} value.

  \item[\AdAttr{Query}]

  % Prose here about a \Attr{Query} value.
