\section{\label{sec:History-6-2}Stable Release Series 6.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the second stable release series of Condor.
All of the new features developed in the 6.1 series are now considered
stable, supported features of Condor.
New releases of 6.2.0 should happen infrequently and will only include
bug fixes and support for new platforms.
New features will be added and tested in the 6.3 development series. 
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:New-6-2-1}Version 6.2.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \Condor{userlog} command is now available on Windows NT.

\item Jobs run in stand-alone checkpointing mode can now take a -\_condor\_nowarn
argument, which silences the warnings from the system call library when you
perform a checkpoint-unsafe action, such as opening a file for reading and
writing.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The entries in the \AdAttr{environment} 
option in a submit file now correctly override the variables brought in
from the \AdAttr{getenv} option on Windows NT.
In previous version of CondorNT, the job would get an environment with the
variable defined multiple times. This bug did not affect UNIX versions of 
Condor.

\item Some service packs of Windows NT had bugs that prevented Condor
from determining the file permissions on input and output files. 6.2.1
uses a different set of API's to determine the permissions and works 
properly across all service packs

\item In versions of Condor previous to 6.2.0, the registry would slowly
grow on Windows NT and sometimes become corrupted. This was fixed in 6.2.0,
but if a previously-corrupted registry was detected Condor aborted. In 6.2.1,
this has been turned into a warning, as it doesn't need to be a fatal error.

\item Fixed a memory-corruption bug in the \Condor{collector}

\item PVM resources in Condor were unable to have more than one
\Attr{@} symbol in a name. 

\item The \Attr{TRANSFER\_FILES} is now set to \Attr{ON\_EXIT}
on UNIX by default for the vanilla universe. Previously, users submitting
from UNIX to NT needed to explicitly enable it or include the executable in
the list of input files for the job to run.

\item If \Attr{TRANSFER\_FILES} was set to \AdAttr{TRUE}
files created during the job's run would be transfered whenever the job was 
vacated and transfered to the next machine the job ran on, but would not be
transfered back to the submit machine when the job finally exited for the last time.

\item Determining the current working directory was broken in stand-alone
checkpointing. 

\item A job's standard output and standard error can now go to the same file.

\item When the \Macro{START\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP} is set to TRUE, the
\Condor{startd} now detects activity on the 
\begin{verbatim}/dev/pts\end{verbatim} devices.  

\item The \Condor{negotiator} in 6.2.0 could incorrectly reject a job
that should have been successfully matched if it previously rejected a 
job. If the same jobs were sent to the \Condor{negotiator} in a different
order, the match that should succeed would. In 6.2.1, the order is no longer
important, and previous rejections will not prevent future matches.

\item The getdents, getdirents, and statfs system calls now work correctly in 
cross-platform submissions.

\item \Condor{compile} is better able to detect which version of Linux
it is running on and which flags it should pass to the linker. This should
help Condor users on non-Red Hat distributions.

\item Fixed a bug in the \Condor{startd} that would cause the daemon
to crash if you set the \Macro{POLLING\_INTERVAL} macro to a value
greater than 60.

\item In \Condor{q}, dash-arguments (e.g., -pool, -run, etc.) were being
parsed incorrectly such that the same arguments specified without a
dash would be interpreted as if the dash were present, making it
impossible to specify ``pool'' or ``globus'' or ``run'' as an owner
argument.

\item Fixed bug in \Condor{submit} that would cause certain submit
file directives to be silently ignored if you used the wrong attribute
name.  
Now, all submit file attributes can use the same names you see in the
job ClassAd (what you'd see with \Condor{q} \Opt{-long}.
For example, you can now use ``CoreSize = 0''  or ``core\_size = 0''
in your submit file, and either one would be recognized.

\item A static limit on the number of clusters the \Condor{schedd}
would accept from the \Condor{negotiator} was removed.

\item On Windows NT, if a job's log file was in a non-existent location,
both the \Condor{submit} and the \Condor{schedd} would crash.

\item Encounting unsupported system calls could cause Condor to corrupt the
signal state of the job. 

\item Fixed some of the error messages in \Condor{submit} so that they
are all consistently formatted.

\item Fixed a bug in the Linux standard universe where \Cmd{calloc}{2}
would not return zero filled memory.

\item \Condor{rm}, \Condor{hold} and \Condor{release} will now return
a non-zero exit status on failure, and only return 0 on success.
Previously, they always returned status 0.

\item If a user accidentally put \begin{verbatim}notify_user = false\end{verbatim} in their submit file, Condor used to treat that
as a valid entry.
Now, \Condor{submit} prints out a warning in this case, telling the
user that they probably want to use 
\begin{verbatim}notification = never\end{verbatim} instead.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item It may be possible to checkpoint with an open socket on IRIX 6.2.
On restart, the job will abort and go back into the queue. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:New-6-2-0}Version 6.2.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent New Features Over the 6.0 Release Series
\begin{itemize}

\item Support for running multiple jobs on SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processor)
machines.

\end{itemize}

\noindent New Features Over the Last Development Series: 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item If \Attr{CkptArch} isn't specified in the job submission file's
\Attr{Requirements} attribute, then automatically add this expression:

\begin{verbatim}
CkptRequirements = ((CkptArch == Arch) || (CkptArch =?= UNDEFINED)) &&
	((CkptOpSys == OpSys) || (CkptOpSys =?= UNDEFINED))
\end{verbatim}

to the \Attr{Requirements} expression. This allows for users who specify
a heterogeneous submission to not have to worry about having their checkpoints
incorrectly starting up on architectures for which they were not designed
to run.

\item The \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_<universe>} config file entries now get
appended to the beginning of the expressions before Condor adds internal
default expressions.  This allows the sysadmin to override any default
policy that Condor enforces.

\item There is now a single \Macro{APPEND\_REQUIREMENTS} attribute
that will get appended to all universe's \Attr{Requirements}
expressions unless a specific \Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD} or
\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA} expression is defined.

\item Increased certain networking parameters to help alleviate the 
\Condor{shadow}'s inability to contact the \Condor{schedd} during heavy load
of the system.

\item Added a \Condor{glidein} man page to the manual.

\item Some of the log messages in the \Condor{startd} were modified to
be more clear and to provide more information.

\item Added a new attribute to the \Condor{startd} ClassAd when the
machine is claimed, \AdAttr{RemoteOwner}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs fixed since 6.1.17
\begin{itemize}

\item On NT, the Registry would increase in size while Condor was
servicing jobs. This has been fixed.

\item Added \File{utmpx} support for Solaris 2.8 to fix a problem where
\AdAttr{KeyBoardIdle} wasn't being set correctly.

\item When doing a \Condor{hold} under NT, the job was removed instead of
held. This has been fixed.

\item When using the \Arg{-master} argument to\Condor{restart}, the
\Condor{master} used to exit instead of restarting.
Now, the \Condor{master} correctly restarts itself in this case.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:
\begin{itemize}

\item \Attr{STARTD\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP} does not work if set to True on Solaris 
2.8.  However, since \File{utmpx} support is enabled, you shouldn't
need to do this normally.

\item \Condor{kbdd} doesn't work properly under Compaq Tru64 5.1, and
as a result, resources may not leave the ``Unclaimed'' state
regardless of keyboard or pty activity.  Compaq Tru64 5.0a and earlier
do work properly.

\end{itemize}
