\begin{itemize}

\item New configuration variables were added to to the \Condor{schedd} to
define statistics that count subsets of jobs. These variables
have the form \Macro{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} and should contain
a ClassAd expression that evaluates to a string.
XXXX_value_ will be prefixed to the names of attributes in the \Condor{schedd} ad
such as \Attr{XXXX_string_JobsStarted} which would be the count of jobs that have
started that evaluate to "value".  An optional variable of the form
\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPIRE\_STATS\_BY\_XXXX} can be used to set an expiration time in seconds
for each set of statistics.
