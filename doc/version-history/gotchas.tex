Occasional changes to Condor can cause unexpected errors or results
to users.
Here is a list of changes to note and be aware of.

\begin{itemize}

\item When upgrading from 6.6.x 6.7.x,
  jobs that rely on the environment variable \Env{CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR}
  need to be changed to use \Env{\_CONDOR\_SCRATCH\_DIR}.
  An underscore was added to the beginning of this variable.

\end{itemize}
