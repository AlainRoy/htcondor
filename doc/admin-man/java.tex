Compiled Java programs may be executed (under Condor) on
any
execution site with a
\index{Java Virtual Machine}
\index{JVM}
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
To do this,
Condor must be informed of some details of the
JVM installation.

Begin by installing a Java distribution according to the vendor's
instructions.
We have successfully used the Sun Java Developer's Kit,
but any distribution should suffice.
Your machine may have
been delivered with a JVM already installed -- installed code
is frequently found in \File{/usr/bin/java}.

Condor's configuration includes the location of the installed
JVM.
Edit the configuration file.
Modify the \Expr{JAVA} entry to point to the JVM binary,
typically \File{/usr/bin/java}.
Restart the \Condor{startd} daemon on that host.  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_restart -startd bluejay
\end{verbatim}

The \Condor{startd} daemon takes a few moments to exercise the Java
capabilites of the \Condor{starter}, query its properties,
and then advertise the machine
to the pool as Java-capable.
If the set up succeeded, then \Condor{status} will
tell you the host is now Java-capable by printing the Java
vendor and the version number:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_status -java bluejay
\end{verbatim}

After a suitable amount of time, if this command does not give any output,
then the \Condor{starter}  is having difficulty executing the JVM.
The exact cause of the problem depends on the details of the
JVM, the local installation, and a variety of other factors.
We cannot offer any specific advice on these matters, but
we can provide an approach to solving the problem.

To reproduce the test that the \Condor{starter} is attempting,
try running the Java \Condor{starter} directly.  To find
where the \Condor{starter} is installed, run this command:

\begin{verbatim}
% condor_config_val STARTER
\end{verbatim}

This command prints out the path to the \Condor{starter},
perhaps something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter
\end{verbatim}

Use this path to execute the \Condor{starter} directly
with the \verb$-classad$ option.  This tells the starter
to run its tests and display its properties:

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/condor/sbin/condor_starter -classad
\end{verbatim}

This command will display a short list of cryptic properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
IsDaemonCore = True
HasFileTransfer = True
HasMPI = True
CondorVersion = "$CondorVersion: 6.2$"
\end{verbatim}

If the Java configuration is correct, you should also
see a short list of Java properties, such as:

\begin{verbatim}
JavaVendor = "Sun Microsystems Inc."
JavaVersion = "1.2.2"
JavaMFlops = 9.279696
HasJava = True
\end{verbatim}

If the Java installation is incorrect, then any error
messages from the shell or Java will be printed
on the error stream instead.
