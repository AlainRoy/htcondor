\section{\label{sec:Contrib-Install}Installing Contrib Modules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes how to install various \Term{contrib modules}
in the Condor system.
Some of these modules are separate, optional pieces, not included in
the main distribution of Condor.
For example, the checkpoint server, or DagMan.
Others are integral parts of Condor taken from the development series
that have certain features users might want to install.
For example, the new SMP-aware \Condor{startd}, or the CondorView
collector.  
Both of these things come automatically with Condor version 6.1 and
greater.
However, if you don't want to switch over to using only the
development binaries, you can install these seperate modules and
maintain most of the stable release at your site.
