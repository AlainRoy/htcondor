\section{\label{sec:UserPrio}User Priorities and Negotiation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Karen's understanding of this stuff, in preparation for a re-write
% of the section:

% Users request machines (by submitting jobs).
% Each user has a calculated priority.
%   A larger priority is worse.
%   This priority essentially tells how many machines the user is
%   currently using.  The priority can be made worse (larger number)
%   by the settings of various configuration variables.
% During each negotiation cycle, all machines are allocated (presuming
%   that there are more requests than machines).
% Each user is allocated machines in a ratio of 1/user's priority.
% Within the negotiation cycle, each user is given an initial
%   allocation of machines.  From there, remaining unallocated machines
%   are divided up among users that want more.  In a round robin
%   manner, each user is allocated a fraction of the remaining
%   unallocated machines.  this fraction is 1/user's priority.

\index{priority!in machine allocation}
\index{user priority}
Condor uses priorities to determine machine allocation for jobs.
This section details the priorities and the allocation of
machines (negotiation).

For accounting purposes, each user is identified by username@uid\_domain.
Each user is assigned a priority value even if submitting jobs from
different machines in the same domain, or even if submitting from multiple
machines in the different domains.

The numerical priority value assigned to a user is inversely related to the 
\emph{goodness} of the priority.
A user with a numerical priority of 5 gets 
more resources than a user with a numerical priority of 50.
There are two 
priority values assigned to Condor users:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real User Priority (RUP), which measures resource usage of the 
		user.
	\item Effective User Priority (EUP), which determines the number of
		resources the user can get.
\end{itemize}
This section describes these two priorities and how they affect resource
allocations in Condor.
Documentation on configuring and controlling 
priorities may be found in section~\ref{sec:Negotiator-Config-File-Entries}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:RUP}Real User Priority (RUP)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{real user priority (RUP)}
\index{user priority!real (RUP)}
A user's RUP measures the resource usage of the user 
through time.
Every user begins with a RUP of one half (0.5), and
at steady state, the RUP of a user equilibrates to the number of resources 
used by that user.  Therefore, if a specific user continuously uses exactly 
ten resources for a long period of time, the RUP of that user stabilizes at 
ten.

However, if the user decreases the number of resources used, the RUP
gets better.  The rate at which the priority value decays 
can be set by the macro \Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE}, a time period 
defined in seconds.   Intuitively, if the \Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE} in a pool 
is set to 86400 (one day), and if a user whose RUP was 10 removes all his 
jobs, the user's RUP would be 5 one day later, 2.5 two days later,
and so on.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:EUP}Effective User Priority (EUP)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{effective user priority (EUP)}
\index{user priority!effective (EUP)}
The effective user priority (EUP) of a user is used to determine
how many resources that user may receive.
The EUP is linearly related to the RUP
by a \emph{priority factor} which may be defined on a per-user basis.
Unless otherwise configured, the priority factor for all users is 1.0,
and so the EUP is the same as the the RUP.
However, if desired, the priority factors of
specific users (such as remote submitters) can be increased so that 
others are served preferentially.

The number of resources that a user may receive is inversely related
to the ratio between the EUPs of submitting users.
Therefore user $A$ with EUP=5 will receive
twice as many resources as user $B$ with EUP=10 and four times as many 
resources as user $C$ with EUP=20.
However, if $A$ does not use the full number
of allocated resources,
the available resources are repartitioned and distributed among
remaining users according to the inverse ratio rule.

Condor supplies mechanisms to directly support two policies in which EUP may
be useful:
\begin{description}
	\item[Nice users]  A job may be submitted with the parameter 
	\AdAttr{nice\_user} set to TRUE in the submit command file.
	A nice user job gets its RUP boosted by the 
	\Macro{NICE\_USER\_PRIO\_FACTOR} priority factor specified in the 
	configuration file, leading to a (usually very large) EUP.
	This corresponds to a low priority for resources.
	These jobs are therefore equivalent to Unix background jobs,
	which use resources not used by other Condor users.

	\item[Remote Users] The flocking feature of Condor (see
	section~\ref{sec:Flocking}) allows the \Condor{schedd} to
	submit to more than one pool.
	In addition, the submit-only feature allows a user to run a
	\Condor{schedd} that is submitting jobs into another pool.
	In such situations, submitters from other domains
	can submit to the local pool.
	It is often desirable to have Condor treat local users
	preferentially over these remote users.
	If configured, Condor will boost the RUPs of remote users by
	\Macro{REMOTE\_PRIO\_FACTOR}
	specified in the configuration file,
	thereby lowering their priority for resources.
\end{description}

The priority boost factors for individual users can be set with the 
\Opt{setfactor} option of \Condor{userprio}.
Details may be found in the \Condor{userprio} manual page 
on page~\pageref{man-condor-userprio}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Priorities and Preemption}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{preemption!priority}
Priorities are used to ensure that users get their fair share of resources.  
The priority values are used at allocation time.
In addition, Condor preempts machine claims and reallocates them when
conditions change.

To ensure that preemptions do not lead to \Term{thrashing}, a
\Macro{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} negotiator configuration expression is
defined to specify the conditions that must be met for a preemption to
occur.  It is usually defined to deny preemption if a current running
job has been running for a relatively short period of time.  This
effectively limits the number of preemptions per resource per time
interval.

Note that \MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} only applies to preemptions
due to user priority.  It does not have any effect if the machine rank
expression prefers a different job, or if the startd policy expression
causes the job to vacate due to other activity on the machine.
See section \ref{sec:Disabling Preemption} for a general discussion of
limiting preemption.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Priority Calculation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section may be skipped if the reader so feels, but for the curious,
here is Condor's priority calculation algorithm.

The RUP of a user $u$ at time $t$, $\pi_r(u,t)$, is calculated 
every time interval $\delta t$ using the formula 
$$\pi_r(u,t) = \beta\times\pi(u,t-\delta t) + (1-\beta)\times\rho(u,t)$$
where $\rho(u,t)$ is the number of resources used by user $u$ at time $t$,
and $\beta=0.5^{{\delta t}/h}$. $h$ is the half life period set by 
\Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE}.

The EUP of user $u$ at time $t$, $\pi_e(u,t)$
is calculated by
$$\pi_e(u,t) = \pi_r(u,t)\times f(u,t)$$
where $f(u,t)$ is the priority boost factor for user $u$ at time $t$.

As mentioned previously, the RUP calculation is designed so that at steady
state, each user's RUP stabilizes at the number of resources used by that user. 
The definition of $\beta$ ensures that the calculation of $\pi_r(u,t)$ can be 
calculated over non-uniform time intervals $\delta t$ without affecting the 
calculation.  The time interval $\delta t$ varies due to events internal to 
the system, but Condor guarantees that unless the central manager machine is 
down, no matches will be unaccounted for due to this variance.

% Derek's explanation:
%  > Preferably the user priority is determined by the number of
%  > processors jobs of the user currently occupy, i.e., the "history"
%  > should not play a role.
%  
%  this is the responsibility of the condor "accountant", which lives
%  inside the condor_negotiator daemon.  the knob you want to turn is
%  called "PRIORITY_HALFLIFE".  think of your user priority as a
%  radioactive substance. :) consider a priority that exactly matches
%  your current resource usage the "stable state", and a priority
%  "contaminated" with past usage "radioactive."  if it's got a long
%  halflife, it takes a long time for your priority to decay back to
%  "normal".  if the halflife is very short, it'll decay very quickly,
%  and will remain very close to your current usage.  so, just set
%  PRIORITY_HALFLIFE to a small floating point value (like 0.0001), and
%  your user priority should always match your current usage.  if you're
%  not using any resources, your priority will go back to the baseline
%  value instantly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:negotiation}Negotiation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{negotiation}
\index{matchmaking!negotiation algorithm}

Negotiation is the method Condor undergoes periodically to
match queued jobs with resources capable of running jobs.
The \Condor{negotiator} daemon is responsible for
negotiation.

During a negotiation cycle, the \Condor{negotiator} daemon
accomplishes the following ordered list of items.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Build a list of all possible resources,
  regardless of the state of those resources.
  \item Obtain a list of all job submitters (for the entire pool).
  \item Sort the list of all job submitters based on EUP
  (see section ~\ref{sec:EUP} for an explanation of EUP).
  The submitter with the best priority is first within the sorted list.
  \item Iterate until there are either no more resources to match,
  or no more jobs to match.
    \begin{description}
      \item For each submitter (in EUP order):
        \begin{description}
          \item For each submitter, get each job.
	  Since jobs may be submitted from more than one machine
	  (hence to more than one \Condor{schedd} daemon),
	  here is a further definition of the ordering of these jobs.
	  With jobs from a single \Condor{schedd} daemon, 
	  jobs are typically returned in job priority order.
	  When more than one \Condor{schedd} daemon is involved,
	  they are contacted in an undefined order. 
	  All jobs from a single \Condor{schedd} daemon are considered
	  before moving on to the next.
	  For each job:
              \begin{itemize}
	        \item For each machine in the pool that can execute jobs:
                  \begin{enumerate}
		  \item If \Expr{machine.requirements} evaluates to
		  \Expr{False} or
		  \Expr{job.requirements} evaluates to \Expr{False},
		  skip this machine
		  \item If the machine is in the Claimed state, but
		  not running a job, skip this machine.
		  \item If this machine is not running a job, add it to
		  the potential match list by reason of
		  No Preemption.
		  \item If the machine is running a job
                    \begin{itemize}
		    \item If the \Expr{machine.RANK} on this job is
		    better than the running job, add this machine to the
		    potential match list by reason of Rank.
		    \item  If the EUP of this job is better than the EUP
		    of the currently running job, and
		    \MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} is \Expr{True},
		    and the \Expr{machine.RANK} on this job is not worse
		    than the currently running job, add this machine to the
		    potential match list by reason of Priority.
                    \end{itemize}
                  \end{enumerate}
	        \item Of machines in the potential match list, sort by
		\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_PRE\_JOB\_RANK}, \Expr{job.RANK},
		\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK}, Reason for claim
		(No Preemption, then Rank, then Priority),
		\MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_RANK}
	        \item The job is assigned to the top machine on the
		potential match list.  The machine is removed
		from the list of resources to match
		(on this negotiation cycle).
              \end{itemize}
          \end{description}
    \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

The \Condor{negotiator} asks the \Condor{schedd} for the 
"next job" from a given submitter/user.
Typically, the \Condor{schedd} returns jobs in the order of
job priority.
If priorities are the same,
job submission time is used; older jobs go first.
If a cluster has multiple procs in it and one of the jobs cannot be matched,
the \Condor{schedd} will not return any more jobs in that cluster
on that negotiation pass.
This is an optimization based on the theory that the cluster jobs are similar.
The configuration variable \Macro{NEGOTIATE\_ALL\_JOBS\_IN\_CLUSTER}
disables the cluster-skipping optimization.
Use of the configuration variable \Macro{SIGNIFICANT\_ATTRIBUTES}
will change the
definition of what the \Condor{schedd} considers a cluster from the
default definition of all jobs that share the same \Attr{ClusterId}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:group-accounting}Group Accounting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{groups!accounting}
\index{accounting!by group}
\index{priority!by group}

By default, Condor does all accounting on a per-user basis, and this
accounting is primarily used to compute priorities for Condor's
fair-share scheduling algorithms. 
However, accounting can also be done on a per-group basis.
Multiple users can all submit jobs into the same accounting group,
and all of the jobs will be treated with the same priority.

\index{ClassAd job attribute!AccountingGroup}
To use an accounting group,
each job inserts an attribute into the job ClassAd which
defines the accounting group name for the job.
A common name is decided upon and used for the group.
The following line is an example that defines the attribute
within the job's submit description file:
\begin{verbatim}
+AccountingGroup = "group_physics"
\end{verbatim}

The \AdAttr{AccountingGroup} attribute is a string,
and it therefore must be enclosed in double quote marks.
The string may have a maximum length of 40 characters.
The name should \emph{not} be qualified with a domain.
Certain parts of the Condor system 
do append the value \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
(as specified in the configuration file on the submit machine)
to this string for internal use.
For example, if the value of \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} is
\Expr{example.com}, and the accounting group name
is as specified,
\Condor{userprio} will show statistics
for this accounting group using the appended domain, for example
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
                                    Effective
User Name                           Priority
------------------------------      ---------
group_physics@example.com                0.50
user@example.com                        23.11
heavyuser@example.com                  111.13
...
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Additionally, the \Condor{userprio} command allows administrators to
remove an entity from the accounting system in Condor.
The \Opt{-delete} option to \Condor{userprio}
accomplishes this
if all the jobs from a given accounting group are completed,
and the administrator wishes to remove that group from the system.
The \Opt{-delete} option
identifies the accounting group with the fully-qualified name
of the accounting group.
For example
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
condor_userprio -delete group_physics@example.com
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Condor removes entities itself as they are no longer
relevant.
Intervention by an administrator to delete entities can
be beneficial when the use of thousands
of short term accounting groups leads to scalability
issues.

Note that the name of an accounting group may include a period (.).
Inclusion of a period character in the accounting group name
only has relevance if the portion of the name before the
period matches a group name,
as described in the next section on group quotas.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:group-quotas}Group Quotas}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{negotiation!by group}
\index{groups!quotas}
\index{quotas!for a group}
The use of group quotas modifies the negotiation for 
available resources (machines) within a Condor pool.
This solves the difficulties inherent when
priorities assigned based on each single user are insufficient.
This may be the case when
different groups (of varying size) own computers,
and the groups choose to combine their computers to
form a Condor pool.
Consider an imaginary Condor pool example with thirty computers;
twenty computers are owned by the physics group and ten
computers are owned by the chemistry group.
One notion of fair allocation could be implemented 
by configuring the twenty machines owned by the physics group
to prefer (using the \MacroNI{RANK} configuration macro)
jobs submitted by the users identified as associated
with the physics group.
Likewise, the ten machines owned by the chemistry group are
configured to prefer jobs from users associated with the
the chemistry group.
This routes jobs to execute on specific machines,
perhaps causing more preemption than necessary.
The (fair allocation) policy desired is likely somewhat different,
if these thirty machines have been pooled.
The desired policy does not tie users to specific sets of machines,
but to numbers of machines (a quota).
Given thirty similar machines,
the desired policy allows users within the physics group to have
preference on up to twenty of the machines within the pool,
and the machines can be any of the machines that are available.

A quota for a set of users requires an identification of
the set; members are called group users.
Jobs under the group quota
specify the group user with the 
\AdAttr{AccountingGroup} job ClassAd attribute.
This is the same attribute as is used with group accounting.

The submit file syntax for specifying a group user includes 
both a group name and a user name.
The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
  +AccountingGroup = "<group>.<user>"
\end{verbatim}
The \verb@group@ is a name chosen for the group.
Group names are case-insensitive for negotiation.
Group names are not required to begin with the
string \AdStr{group\_},
as in the examples
\AdStr{group\_physics.newton} and \AdStr{group\_chemistry.curie},
but it is a useful convention,
because group names must not conflict with user names.
The period character between the group and the user name is
a required part of the syntax.  \Note  An accounting
group value lacking the period will cause the job to not 
be considered part of the
group when negotiating, even if the group name has a quota.
Furthermore, there will be no warnings that the group quota is not
in effect for the job, as this syntax defines group accounting.

Configuration controls the order of negotiation for
groups and individual users,
as well as sets quotas
(preferentially allocated numbers of machines)
for the groups.
A declared number of slots specifies the quota for each group
(see \MacroNI{GROUP\_QUOTA\_<groupname>}
in section~\ref{param:GroupQuotaGroupname}).
The sum of the quotas for all groups must be less than or equal to
the number of slots in the entire pool.
If the sum is less than the number of
slots in the entire pool,
the slots are 
allocated to the \verb@none@ group,
comprised of the general
users not submitting jobs in a group.

Where group users are specified for jobs,
accounting is done per group user.
It is no longer done by group, or by individual user.

Negotiation is changed when group quotas are used.
Condor negotiates first for defined groups,
and then for independent job submitters.
Given jobs belonging to different groups,
Condor negotiates first for the group 
currently utilizing the smallest percentage of machines
in its quota.
After this,
Condor negotiates for the group 
currently utilizing the second smallest percentage of machines
in its quota.
The last group will be the one with the highest percentage
of machines in its quota.
As an example, again use the imaginary pool and groups 
given above.
If various users within \verb@group_physics@ have
jobs running on 15 computers, 
then the physics group has 75\% of the 
machines within its quota.
If various users within \verb@group_chemistry@ have
jobs running on 5 computers, 
then the chemistry group has 50\% of the 
machines within its quota.
Negotiation will take place for the chemistry group first.
For independent job submissions (those not part of any group),
the classic Condor user fair share algorithm still applies.

Note that there is no verification that a user is a member of
the group that he claims.
We rely on societal pressure for enforcement. 

Configuration variables affect group quotas.
See section~\ref{sec:Negotiator-Config-File-Entries} for detailed
descriptions of the variables mentioned.
Group names that may be given quotas to be used in
negotiation are listed in the \Macro{GROUP\_NAMES} macro.
The names chosen must not conflict with Condor user names.
Quotas (by group) are defined in numbers of machine slots.
Each group may be assigned an initial value for its
user priority factor with the \Macro{GROUP\_PRIO\_FACTOR\_<groupname>}
macro.
If a group is currently allocated its entire quota of machines,
and a group user has a submitted job that is not running,
the \Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP} macro allows the job to be
considered a second time within the negotiation cycle
along with all other individual users' jobs.

\begin{verbatim}
  ####################
  #
  # Example 1
  # Configuration for group quotas
  #
  ####################

  GROUP_NAMES = group_physics, group_chemistry
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_physics = 20
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_chemistry = 10
  GROUP_PRIO_FACTOR_group_physics = 1.0
  GROUP_PRIO_FACTOR_group_chemistry = 3.0
  GROUP_AUTOREGROUP_group_physics = FALSE
  GROUP_AUTOREGROUP_group_chemistry = TRUE
\end{verbatim}

This configuration specifies that the \verb@group_physics@ users will
get 20 machines and the \verb@group_chemistry@ users will get
ten machines.  \verb@group_physics@ users will never get more than
20 machines; however, \verb@group_chemistry@ users can potentially get
more than ten machines because \Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP\_chemistry}
is true.
This could happen, for example, if there are only 15 jobs
submitted by \verb@group_physics@ users.
Also, the default priority
factor for the physics groups is 1.0, and the default priority factor
for the chemistry group is 3.0.


\begin{verbatim}
  ####################
  #
  # Submit description file for group quota user
  #
  ####################
  ...
  +AccountingGroup = "group_physics.newton"
  ...
\end{verbatim}

This submit file specifies that this job is to be negotiated as part of
the \verb@group_physics@ group and that the user is newton.
Remember that
both the group name and the user name are required for the group quota
to take effect.
