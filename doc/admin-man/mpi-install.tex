\Notice{The MPI contrib module for this version of Condor has been
removed.
It was a too old and too buggy to be useful. A new implementation
of the MPI contrib module is currently being tested.
When it is finished, MPI support will again exist in Condor.
Watch this section of the
manual for its release.}
