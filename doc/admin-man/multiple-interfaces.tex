% CMNT I'm going to leave the original documentation here in case someone
% CMNT needs the CM_IP_ADDR stuff better documented. For now, though, I've
% CMNT removed it from the documentation because the code should deal with
% CMNT CONDOR_HOST being a straight ip_addr just fine. The new docs I've
% CMNT written don't even reference CM_IP_ADDR because it seems the code
% CMNT doesn't need it.

%Beginning with Condor version 6.1.5, Condor can run on machines with
%multiple network interfaces.
%Basically, you tell each host with multiple interfaces which IP
%address you want the host to use for ingoing and outgoing Condor
%network communication.
%You do this by setting the \Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} parameter in
%the local config file for each host you need to.
%There are a few other special cases you might have to deal with,
%described below.
%
%If your Central Manager is on a machine with multiple interfaces,
%instead of defining the \Macro{COLLECTOR\_HOST} or
%\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} parameters (which are usually both defined in
%terms of \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST}), you should set the
%\Macro{CM\_IP\_ADDR}.
%
%\Warn The default \Macro{HOSTALLOW\_ADMINISTRATOR} setting in the
%config file references \MacroU{CONDOR\_HOST}, and the default
%\Macro{HOSTALLOW\_NEGOTIATOR} setting references
%\MacroU{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST}.
%So you'll need to change both of these settings to reference
%\MacroU{CM\_IP\_ADDR} instead.   
%
%If your Checkpoint Server is on a machine with multiple interfaces,
%the only way to get things to work is if your different interfaces
%have different hostnames associated with them, and you set
%\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST} to the hostname that corresponds with the
%IP address you want to use.  
%You will still need to specify \Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} in the local
%config file for your Checkpoint Server.

Beginning with Condor version 6.1.5, Condor can run on machines with
multiple network interfaces.
However, starting with Condor version 6.7.13, new functionality is
available that allows even better support for multi-homed
machines, using the configuration variable \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES}.
A multi-homed machine is one that has more than one
NIC (Network Interface Card).
Further improvements to this new functionality will remove the need
for any special configuration in the common case.
For now, care
must still be given to machines with multiple NICs, even
when using this new configuration variable.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Using-BindAllInterfaces}Using 
\Macro{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Starting with Condor version 6.7.13, machines can be configured such that
whenever Condor daemons or tools
call \Syscall{bind}, the daemons or tools use all network interfaces on
the machine.
This means that outbound connections will always use the appropriate
network interface to connect to a remote host,
instead of being forced to use
an interface that might not have a route to the given destination.
Furthermore, sockets upon which a daemon listens for incoming connections 
will be bound to all network interfaces on the machine.
This means that so long as remote clients know the right port, they can
use any IP address on the machine and still contact a given Condor daemon.

To enable this functionality, the boolean configuration
variable
\MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES}
is defined and set to \Expr{True}:

\begin{verbatim}
BIND_ALL_INTERFACES = TRUE
\end{verbatim}

This functionality has limitations,
and therefore has a default value of \Expr{False}.
Here are descriptions of the limitations.

\begin{description}

\item[Using all network interfaces does not work with Kerberos.] 
  Every Kerberos ticket contains a specific IP address within it.
  Authentication over a socket (using Kerberos) requires
  the socket to also specify that same specific IP address.
  Use of \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} causes outbound
  connections from a multi-homed machine to 
  originate over any of the interfaces.
  Therefore, the IP address of the outbound connection and the IP
  address in the Kerberos ticket will not necessarily match,
  causing the authentication to fail.
  Sites using Kerberos authentication on multi-homed machines are
  strongly encouraged not to enable \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES},
  at least until Condor's Kerberos functionality
  supports using multiple Kerberos tickets together with finding the right one
  to match the IP address a given socket is bound to. 

\item[There is a potential security risk.]
  Consider the following example of a security risk.
  A multi-homed machine is at a network boundary.
  One interface is on the public Internet, while the other connects to
  a private network.
  Both the multi-homed machine and the private network machines
  comprise a Condor pool.
  If the multi-homed machine enables \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES},
  then it is at risk from hackers trying to compromise the security of the pool.
  Should this multi-homed machine be compromised,
  the entire pool is vulnerable.
  If no access from the public Internet to the Condor pool running on
  the private network is required,
  then there is no reason to have Condor daemons listening on ports on the public
  Internet, causing a potential security threat.

\item[Only one IP address will be advertised.]
  At present, even though a given Condor daemon will be listening to
  ports on multiple interfaces, each with their own IP address,
  there is currently no mechanism for that daemon to advertise all of
  the possible IP addresses where it can be contacted.
  Therefore, Condor clients (other Condor daemons or tools) will not
  necessarily able to locate and communicate with a given daemon
  running on a multi-homed machine where
  \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} has been enabled.

  Currently, Condor daemons can only advertise a single IP address in
  the ClassAd they send to their \Condor{collector}.
  Condor tools and other daemons only know how to look up a single IP
  address, and they attempt to use that single IP address
  when connecting to the daemon.
  So, even if the daemon is listening on 2 or more different interfaces,
  each with a separate IP, the daemon must choose what IP address to
  publicly advertise so that other daemons and tools can locate it.

  By default, Condor advertises the first IP address it finds
  when looking up the host information for itself.  
  The \Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} setting can still be used to
  specify the IP address Condor should advertise, even if
  \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} is set to \Expr{True}.
  Therefore, some of the considerations described below regarding what
  interface should be used in various situations still apply when
  deciding what interface is to be advertised.

\end{description}

Sites that make heavy use of private networks and multi-homed machines
should consider if using Generic Connection Brokering, GCB, is
right for them.
More information about GCB and Condor can be found in
section~\ref{sec:GCB} on page~\pageref{sec:GCB}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Central Manager with Two or More NICs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Often users of Condor wish to set up ``compute farms'' where there is one
machine with two network interface cards (one for the public Internet,
and one for the private net). It is convenient to set up the ``head''
node as a central manager in most cases and so here are the instructions
required to do so.

Setting up the central manager on a machine with more than one NIC can
be a little confusing because there are a few external variables
that could make the process difficult. One of the biggest mistakes
in getting this to work is that either one of the separate interfaces is
not active, or the host/domain names associated with the interfaces are
incorrectly configured. 

Given that the interfaces are up and functioning, and they have good
host/domain names associated with them here is how to configure Condor:

In this example, \Bold{farm-server.farm.org} maps to the private interface.

On the central manager's global (to the cluster) configuration file: \\
\Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} = \Bold{farm-server.farm.org}

On your central manager's local configuration file: \\
\MacroNI{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} = ip address of \Bold{farm-server.farm.org} \\
\MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR} = \MacroUNI{SBIN}/condor\_negotiator \\
\MacroNI{COLLECTOR} = \MacroUNI{SBIN}/condor\_collector \\
\MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST} = \MacroNI{MASTER}, \MacroNI{COLLECTOR}, \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR}, \MacroNI{SCHEDD}, \MacroNI{STARTD}

If your central manager and farm machines are all NT, then you only have
vanilla universe and it will work now.  However, if you have this setup
for UNIX, then at this point, standard universe jobs should be able to
function in the pool, but if you did not configure the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}
macro to be homogeneous across the farm machines, the standard universe
jobs will run as \Bold{nobody} on the farm machines.

In order to get vanilla jobs and file server load balancing for standard
universe jobs working (under Unix), do some more work both in
the cluster you have put together and in Condor to make everything work.
First, you need a file server (which could also be the central manager) to
serve files to all of the farm machines. This could be NFS or AFS, it does
not really matter to Condor. The mount point of the directories you wish
your users to use must be the same across all of the farm machines. Now,
configure \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} and \Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} to be
homogeneous across the farm machines and the central manager. Now, you
will have to inform Condor that an NFS or AFS filesystem exists and that
is done in this manner. In the global (to the farm) configuration file:

\begin{verbatim}
# If you have NFS
USE_NFS = True
# If you have AFS
HAS_AFS = True
USE_AFS = True
# if you want both NFS and AFS, then enable both sets above
\end{verbatim}

Now, if you've set up your cluster so that it is possible for a machine
name to never have a domain name (for example: there is machine
name but no fully qualified domain name in \File{/etc/hosts}), you must
configure \Macro{DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME} to be the domain that you wish
to be added on to the end of your host name.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Client Machine with Multiple Interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you have a client machine with two or more NICs, then there might be
a specific network interface with which you desire a client machine to
communicate with the rest of the Condor pool. In this case, in the local
configuration file for that machine, place: \\ 
\Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} = ip address of interface desired \\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Checkpoint Server on a Machine with Multiple NICs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If your Checkpoint Server is on a machine with multiple interfaces,
the only way to get things to work is if your different interfaces
have different host names associated with them, and you set
\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST} to the host name that corresponds with the
IP address you want to use in the global configuration file for your pool.
You will still need to specify \Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} in the local
config file for your Checkpoint Server.
