Quill is an optional component of Condor that maintains a mirror 
of Condor operational data
in a relational database.  The \Condor{quill} daemon updates
the data in the relation database, and the \Condor{dbmsd} daemon
maintains the database itself.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Quill-Installation}Installation and Configuration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Quill uses the \Prog{PostgreSQL} database management system.
Quill uses the \Prog{PostgreSQL} server as its back end
and client library, 
\Prog{libpq} to talk to the server.
We \Bold{strongly recommend} the use of version 
8.2 or later due to its integrated facilities of certain key 
database maintenance tasks, and stronger security features.

Obtain \Prog{PostgreSQL} from

\URL{http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/}

Installation instructions are detailed in:
\URL{http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/installation.html}

Configure \Prog{PostgreSQL} after installation:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Configure to accept TCP/IP connections.
For \Prog{PostgreSQL} version 8,
use the \Code{listen\_addresses} variable in 
\File{postgresql.conf} file as a guide.
For example,
\Code{listen\_addresses = '*'}
means listen on any IP interface.

\item Configure automatic vacuuming.
Ensure that these variables with these defaults are
commented in and/or set properly in the 
\File{postgresql.conf} configuration file:
\begin{verbatim}
# Turn on/off automatic vacuuming
autovacuum = on

# time between autovacuum runs, in secs
autovacuum_naptime = 60

# min # of tuple updates before vacuum
autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 1000

# min # of tuple updates before analyze
autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 500

# fraction of rel size before vacuum
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.4 

# fraction of rel size before analyze
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.2

# default vacuum cost delay for 
   # autovac, -1 means use 
   # vacuum_cost_delay
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = -1  

# default vacuum cost limit for 
   # autovac, -1 means use
   # vacuum_cost_limit
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = -1   
\end{verbatim}


\item Configure \Prog{PostgreSQL} to accept TCP/IP connections from 
specific hosts.
Modify the \File{pg\_hba.conf} file 
(which usually resides in the \Prog{PostgreSQL} server's data directory).
Access is required by the \Condor{quill} daemon,
as well as the database users
\Username{quillreader} and \Username{quillwriter}.
For example, to give
database users \Username{quillreader} and \Username{quillwriter}
password-enabled access to all databases on current machine from any
other machine in the network, add the following:

\begin{tabular}{llllll}
host&all&quillreader&128.105.0.0&255.255.0.0&md5\\
host&all&quillwriter&128.105.0.0&255.255.0.0&md5
\end{tabular}

Note that in addition to the database specified by
the configuration variable \MacroNI{QUILL\_DB\_NAME},
the \Condor{quill} daemon also needs access to the database
"template1".
In order to create the database in the first place, 
the \Condor{quill} daemon needs to connect to the database.

\item Start the \Prog{PostgreSQL} server service. See the URL for the
installation instructions for the appropriate method to start the service.

\item The \Condor{quill} and \Condor{dbmsd} daemons and client tools connect
to the database as users \Username{quillreader} and 
\Username{quillwriter}.
These are database users, not operating system users.
The two types of users are quite different from each other.
If these database users do not exist,
add them using the 
\Prog{createuser} command supplied with the installation.
Assign them with appropriate passwords;
these passwords will be used by the Quill tools to connect
to the database in a secure way.
User \Username{quillreader} should not be allowed to create
more databases nor create more users.
User \Username{quillwriter} should
not be allowed to create more users,
however it should be allowed to create more databases.
The following commands create the two users
with the appropriate permissions,
and be ready to enter the corresponding passwords when prompted.

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
/path/to/postgreSQL/bin/directory/createuser quillreader \
	--no-createdb --no-adduser --pwprompt

/path/to/postgreSQL/bin/directory/createuser quillwriter \
	--createdb --no-adduser --pwprompt
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Answer ``no'' to the question about the ability for role creation.

\item The \Condor{quill} and \Condor{dbmsd} daemons need read and write access
to the database.
They connects as user \Username{quillwriter},
which has owner privileges to the database.
Since this gives all access to the \Username{quillwriter} user,
this password cannot be stored in a public place 
(such as the \Condor{collector}).
For this reason, the \Username{quillwriter} password is stored
in a file named \File{.pgpass} in the Condor spool directory.
Appropriate protections on this file guarantee secure access to the database.
This file must be created and protected by the site administrator;
if this file does not exist as and where expected, the \Condor{quill}
and \Condor{dbmsd} daemons log an error and exit.
The \File{.pgpass} is a colon-separated file
with exactly one line. 
This line contains the name of the server running
the database, followed by the TCP port number, followed by the
name of the database, followed by "quillwriter", followed by the password.
The name of the server must match exactly the setting for 
\Macro{QUILL\_DB\_IP\_ADDR}.
Condor uses a string comparison between the two, and does not resolve the
hostnames to compare IP addresses.
Example:
\begin{verbatim}
machinename.cs.wisc.edu:5432:quill:quillwriter:password
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

After the \Prog{PostgreSQL} database is initialized and running, 
the Quill schema
must be loaded into it.  First, load the plsql programming language
into the server:

\begin{verbatim}
createlang plpgsql [databasename]
\end{verbatim}

Then, load the Quill schema from the sql files in the \File{sql} subdirectory
of the Condor release directory:

\begin{verbatim}
psql < common_createddl.sql
psql < pgsql_createddl.sql
\end{verbatim}


After \Prog{PostgreSQL} is configured and running, Condor must also be
configured to use Quill, since by default Quill is configured to be off.

\begin{description}
\item Add the file \File{.pgpass} to the 
  \MacroNI{VALID\_SPOOL\_FILES} variable, since \Condor{preen} must
  be told not to delete this file.
\item Set up configuration variables that are specific
  to the installation.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
QUILL_ENABLED           = TRUE
QUILL_NAME              = some-unique-quill-name.cs.wisc.edu
QUILL_DB_NAME           = database-for-some-unique-quill-name
QUILL_DB_IP_ADDR        = databaseipaddress:port
# the following parameter's units is in seconds
QUILL_POLLING_PERIOD    = 10
# the following parameter's units is in hours
QUILL_HISTORY_CLEANING_INTERVAL = 24
# the following parameter's units is in days
QUILL_HISTORY_DURATION 	= 30
QUILL_MANAGE_VACUUM = FALSE
QUILL_IS_REMOTELY_QUERYABLE = TRUE
QUILL_DB_QUERY_PASSWORD =  password-for-database-user-quillreader
QUILL_ADDRESS_FILE      = $(LOG)/.quill_address
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\end{description}


Descriptions of these and other configuration variables are in
section~\ref{sec:Quill-Config-File-Entries}.
Here are further brief details:

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_DB\_NAME} and \Macro{QUILL\_DB\_IP\_ADDR}]
These two variables are used to determine the location of the database
server that this Quill would talk to, and the name of the database that
it creates.  More than one Quill server can talk to the same database
server.  This can be done by simply letting all the 
\MacroNI{QUILL\_DB\_IP\_ADDR} point to the same database server.

If more than one Quill server are sharing the same database
server, then the \MacroNI{QUILL\_DB\_NAME} variable for all of them should
be unique.  Otherwise, there would be record overwriting and corruption
of job queue information.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_NAME}]
Each quill daemon in the pool has to be uniquely named.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_POLLING\_PERIOD}]
This controls the frequency with which Quill polls the
\File{job\_queue.log} file.  By default, it is 10 seconds.  Since Quill
works by periodically sniffing the log file for updates and then sending
those updates to the database, this variable controls the trade off between
the currency of query results and Quill's load on the system, which
is usually negligible.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_HISTORY\_CLEANING\_INTERVAL} and 
		\Macro{QUILL\_HISTORY\_DURATION}]
These two variables control the deletion of historical jobs from the
database. 
\MacroNI{QUILL\_HISTORY\_DURATION} is the number of days
after completion that a given job will stay in the database.  
A more precise definition is the number of days since the history ad got 
into the history database; those two might be different,
if a job is completed but stays in the queue for a while.
All jobs beyond \MacroNI{QUILL\_HISTORY\_DURATION} will be deleted.
As scanning the entire database for old jobs can be expensive,
the other variable \MacroNI{QUILL\_HISTORY\_CLEANING\_INTERVAL}
is the number of hours between two successive scans.  By default,
\MacroNI{QUILL\_HISTORY\_DURATION} is set to 180 days and
\MacroNI{QUILL\_HISTORY\_CLEANING\_INTERVAL} is set to 24 hours.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_MANAGE\_VACUUM}]
Set to \Expr{False} by default, this variable determines whether Quill is to 
perform vacuuming tasks on its tables or not. Vacuuming is a maintenance 
task that needs to be performed on tables in \Prog{PostgreSQL}. The 
frequency with which a table is vacuumed typically depends on the number 
of updates (inserts/deletes) performed on the table. Fortunately, with 
\Prog{PostgreSQL} version 8.1, vacuuming tasks can be configured to be 
performed automatically by the database server. We recommend that users 
upgrade to 8.1 and use the integrated vacuuming facilities of the database 
server, instead of having Quill do them. If the user does prefer having 
Quill perform those vacuuming tasks, it can be achieved by setting this 
variable to Expr{True}. However, it cannot be overstated that Quill's vacuuming 
policy is quite rudimentary as compared to the integrated facilities 
of the database server, and under high update workloads, can prove to 
be a bottleneck on the Quill daemon. As such, setting this variable to 
Expr{True} results in some warning messages in the log file regarding this 
issue.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_IS\_REMOTELY\_QUERYABLE}]
Thanks to 
\Prog{PostgreSQL},
one can now remotely query both the job queue and the
history tables. This variable controls whether this remote querying 
feature should be enabled.  By default it is \Expr{True}.  Note that even if 
this is \Expr{False}, one can still query the job queue 
at the remote \Condor{schedd} daemon.
This variable only controls whether the database tables are remotely queryable.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_DB\_QUERY\_PASSWORD}]
In order for the query tools to connect to a database, they need to provide
the password that is assigned to the database user \Username{quillreader}. 
This variable is then advertised by the \Condor{quill} daemon
to the \Condor{collector}.  
This facility enables remote querying: remote \Condor{q} query tools first 
ask the \Condor{collector} for
the password associated with a particular Quill database, 
and then query that database.  Users who do not have access to the 
\Condor{collector} 
cannot view the password, and as such cannot query the database.  Again, this 
password only provides read access to the database.

\item[\Macro{QUILL\_ADDRESS\_FILE}]
When Quill starts up, it can place its address (IP and port)
into a file.  This way, tools running on the local machine do not
need to query the central manager to find Quill.  This 
feature can be turned off by commenting out the variable.

\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Quill-Example}Four Usage Examples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{enumerate}
\item Query a remote Quill daemon on \File{regular.cs.wisc.edu}
for all the jobs in the queue
\begin{verbatim}
	condor_q -name quill@regular.cs.wisc.edu
	condor_q -name schedd@regular.cs.wisc.edu

\end{verbatim}
There are two ways to get to a Quill daemon: directly using its name as 
specified in the \MacroNI{QUILL\_NAME} configuration variable, or indirectly
by querying the \Condor{schedd} daemon using its name.
In the latter case, \Condor{q} will detect 
if that \Condor{schedd} daemon is being serviced by a database, and if so, directly query it.
In both cases, the IP address and port of the database server hosting the data of 
this particular remote Quill daemon can be figured out by the \MacroNI{QUILL\_DB\_IP\_ADDR} 
and \MacroNI{QUILL\_DB\_NAME} variables specified in the \MacroNI{QUILL\_AD}
sent by the quill daemon to the collector and in the \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_AD} sent by
the \Condor{schedd} daemon.  

\item Query a remote Quill daemon on \File{regular.cs.wisc.edu} for all historical 
jobs belonging to owner einstein.
\begin{verbatim}
	condor_history -name quill@regular.cs.wisc.edu einstein
\end{verbatim}

\item Query the local Quill daemon for the average time spent in the queue 
for all non-completed jobs. 
\begin{verbatim}
	condor_q -avgqueuetime 
\end{verbatim}
The average queue time is defined as the average of
\Expr{(currenttime - jobsubmissiontime)} over all jobs which are neither
completed \Expr{(JobStatus == 4)} or removed \Expr{(JobStatus == 3)}.

\item Query the local Quill daemon for all historical jobs completed since 
Apr 1, 2005 at 13h 00m.
\begin{verbatim}
	condor_history -completedsince '04/01/2005 13:00'
\end{verbatim}
It fetches all jobs
which got into the 'Completed' state on or after the
specified time stamp.  It use the \Prog{PostgreSQL} date/time
syntax rules, as it encompasses most format options.  See
\URL{http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/datatype-datetime.html\#AEN4516}
for the various time stamp formats.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Quill-Security}Quill and Security}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are several layers of security in Quill, some provided by Condor and
others provided by the database.  First, all accesses to the database
are password-protected.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The query tools, \Condor{q} and
\Condor{history} connect to the database as user \Username{quillreader}.
The password for this user can vary from one database to another and
as such, each Quill daemon advertises this password to the collector.
The query tools then obtain this password from the collector and
connect successfully to the database.  Access to the database by the
\Username{quillreader} user is read-only, as this is sufficient for the
query tools.  The \Condor{quill} daemon ensures this protected access using the sql
GRANT command when it first creates the tables in the database.  Note that
access to the \Username{quillreader} password itself can be blocked by
blocking access to the collector, a feature already supported in Condor.

\item The \Condor{quill} daemon, on the other hand, needs read and write access
to the database.  As such, it connects as user \Username{quillwriter},
who has owner privileges to the database.  Since this gives all
access to the \Username{quillwriter} user, this password cannot
be stored in a public place (such as the collector).  For this
reason, the \Username{quillwriter} password is stored in a file called
\File{.quillwritepassword} in the Condor spool directory.
Appropriate protections on this file guarantee secure access to the database.
This file must be created and protected by the site administrator;
if this file does not exist as and where expected, the \Condor{quill}
daemon logs an error and exits.

\item The \Attr{IsRemotelyQueryable} attribute in the Quill ClassAd advertised
by the Quill daemon to the collector can be used by site administrators
to disallow the database from being read by all remote Condor query tools.

\end{enumerate}
