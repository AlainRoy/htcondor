\section{\label{sec:Configuring-Condor}
Configuring Condor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes how to configure all parts of the Condor
system.  First, we describe some general information about the config
files, their syntax, etc.  Then, we describe settings that effect all
Condor daemons and tools.  Finally, we have a section describing the
settings for each part of Condor.  The only exception to this are the
settings that control the policy under which Condor will start,
suspend, resume, vacate or kill jobs.  These settings (and other
important concepts from the \Condor{startd}) are described in 
section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on ``Configuring Condor's Job
Execution Policy''. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Intro-to-Config-Files}
Introduction to Config Files}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Condor configuration files are used to customize how Condor
operates at a given site.  The basic configuration as shipped with
Condor should work well for most sites, with a few exceptions of
things that might need special customization.  Please see the section
from the Installation section of this manual for details on where
Condor's config files are found.

Each condor program will, as part of its initialization process,
``configure'' itself by calling a library routine which parses the
various config files that might be used including pool-wide,
platform-specific, machine-specific, and root-owned config files.  The
result is a list of constants and expressions which the program may
evaluate as needed at run time.

Definitions in the configuration file come in two flavors, macros and
expressions.  Macros provide string valued constants which remain
static throughout the execution of the program.  Expressions can be
arithmetic, boolean, or string valued, and can be evaluated
dynamically at run time.

The order in which Macros and Expressions are defined is important,
since you cannot define anything in terms of something else that
hasn't been defined yet.  This is particularly important if you break
up your config files using the \Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} setting
described in sections~\ref{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries}
and~\ref{sec:Multiple-Platforms} below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Config-File-Macros}
Config File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Macro definitions are of the form:

\begin{verbatim}
        <macro_name> = <macro_definition>
\end{verbatim}

\Note You must have whitespace between the macro name, the
``='' sign, and the macro definition.  Macro invocations are of the
form: 

\begin{verbatim}
        $(macro_name)
\end{verbatim}

Macro definitions may contain references to \textbf{previously defined
  macros}.  Nothing in a config file can reference Macros which have
  not yet been defined.  Thus,

\begin{verbatim}
        A = xxx
        C = $(A) 
\end{verbatim}

is a legal set of macro definitions, and the resulting value of ``C'' is
``xxx''.  Note that ``C'' is actually bound to ``\MacroU{A}'', not its value, thus

\begin{verbatim}
        A = xxx
        C = $(A)
        A = yyy
\end{verbatim}

is also a legal set of macro definitions and the resulting value of
``C'' is ``yyy''.  However, 

\begin{verbatim}
        A = $(C)
        C = xxx
\end{verbatim}

is not legal, and will result in the Condor daemons and tools exiting
when they try to parse their config files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Config-File-Expressions}
Config File Expressions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Expression definitions are of the form:

\begin{verbatim}
        <expression_name> : <expression>
\end{verbatim}

\Note You must have whitespace between the expression name,
the ``:'' sign, and the expression definition.  Expressions may
contain constants, operators, and other expressions.  Macros may also
be used to aid in writing expressions.  Constants may be booleans,
denoted by ``true'' (or ``t'') or ``false'' (or ``f''), signed
integers, floating point values, or strings enclosed in double quotes
(").  All config file expressions are simply inserted into various
ClassAds.  Please see the appendix on ClassAds for details about
ClassAd expression operators, and how ClassAd expressions are
evaluated.

Note that expression which contain references to other expressions are
bound to the expressions definition, not its current value, but
expressions which contain macro invocations are bound to the current
value of the macro.  Thus

\begin{verbatim}
        X : "xxx"
        Y : X
        X : "yyy"
\end{verbatim}

will result in ``Y'' being evaluated as ``yyy'' at run time, but

\begin{verbatim}
        X = "xxx"
        Y : $(X)
        X = "yyy" 
\end{verbatim}

will result in ``Y'' having a run time value of ``xxx''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Other-Syntax}
Other Syntax}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Other than macros and expressions, a Condor config file can contain
comments or continuations.  A comment is any line begining with a
``\#''.  A continuation is any entry (either macro or expression) that
continues across multiples lines.  This is accomplished with the
``$\backslash$'' sign at the end of any line that you wish to continue onto
another.  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
        START : (KeyboardIdle > 15 * $(MINUTE)) && \
                ((LoadAvg - CondorLoadAvg) <= 0.3)
\end{verbatim}

or,

\begin{verbatim}
        ADMIN_MACHINES = condor.cs.wisc.edu, raven.cs.wisc.edu, \
                        stork.cs.wisc.edu, ostrich.cs.wisc.edu, \
                        bigbird.cs.wisc.edu
        HOSTALLOW_ADMIN = $(ADMIN_MACHINES)
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Pre-Defined-Macros-and-Expressions}
Pre-Defined Macros and Expressions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Condor provides a number of pre-defined macros and expressions that
help you configure Condor.  Pre-defined macros are listed as
\MacroU{macro\_name}, while pre-defined expressions are just listed as
\Expr{expression\_name}, to denote how they should be referenced in
other macros or expressions.

The first set are special entries whose values are determined at
runtime and cannot be overridden.  These are inserted automatically by
the library routine which parses the config files.

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Expr{CurrentTime}] \label{param:CurrentTime} This expression
  provides the current result of the system call \Cmd{time}{2}.  This
  is an integer containing the number of seconds since an arbitrary
  date defined by UNIX as the ``beginning of time'', hereafter
  referred to as the \Term{UNIX date}.
  
\item[\MacroU{FULL\_HOSTNAME}] \label{param:FullHostname} This is the
  fully qualified hostname of the local machine (hostname plus domain
  name).
  
\item[\MacroU{HOSTNAME}] \label{param:Hostname} This is just the
  hostname of the local machine (no domain name).
  
\item[\MacroU{TILDE}] \label{param:Tilde} This is the full path to the
  home directory of user ``condor'', if such a user exists on the
  local machine.

\item[\MacroU{SUBSYSTEM}] \label{param:Subsystem} This ``subsystem''
  name of the daemon or tool that is evaluating the macro.  The
  different subsystem names are described in
  section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} below.

\end{description}

The final set are entries whose default values are determined
automatically at runtime but which can be overridden.  

\begin{description}

\item[\MacroU{ARCH}] \label{param:Arch} This setting defines the string
  used to identify the architecture of the local machine to Condor.
  The \Condor{startd} will advertise itself with this attribute so
  that users can submit binaries compiled for a given platform and
  force them to run on the correct machines.  \Condor{submit} will
  automatically append a requirement to the job ClassAd that it must
  run on the same \Macro{ARCH} and \Macro{OPSYS} of the machine where
  it was submitted, unless the user specifies \Macro{ARCH} and/or
  \Macro{OPSYS} explicitly in their submit file.  See the
  \Cmd{\condor{submit}}{1} man page for details.  

\item[\MacroU{OPSYS}] \label{param:OpSys} This setting defines the
  string used to identify the operating system of the local machine to
  Condor.  See the entry on \Macro{ARCH} above for more information.
  If this setting is not defined in the config file, Condor will
  automatically insert the operating system of this machine as
  determined by\Prog{uname}.  

\item[\MacroU{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}] This parameter defaults to the fully
  qualified hostname of the machine it is evaluated on.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries} on ``Shared
  Filesystem Config File Entries'' below for the full description of
  its use and under what conditions you would want to override it.

\item[\MacroU{UID\_DOMAIN}] This parameter defaults to the fully
  qualified hostname of the machine it is evaluated on.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries} on ``Shared
  Filesystem Config File Entries'' below for the full description of
  its use and under what conditions you would want to override it.

\end{description}

Since \Macro{ARCH} and \Macro{OPSYS} will automatically be set to the
right things, we recomend that you do not override them yourself.
Only do so if you know what you are doing.
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}
Condor Subsystem Names}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE:} Many of the entries in the config file will
be named with the \Term{subsystem} of the various Condor daemons.
This is a unique string which identifies a given daemon within the
Condor system.  The possible subsystem names are:

\begin{itemize}
\item STARTD
\item SCHEDD
\item MASTER
\item COLLECTOR
\item NEGOTIATOR
\item KBDD 
\item SHADOW
\item STARTER
\item CKPT\_SERVER
\item SUBMIT
\label{list:subsystem names}
\end{itemize}

In the description of the actual config file entries, ``SUBSYS'' will
stand for one of these possible subsystem names.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries}
Condor-wide Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section describes settings which effect all parts of the Condor
system. 

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_HOST}] \label{param:CondorHost} This macro is
  just used to define the \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} and
  \Macro{COLLECTOR\_HOST} macros.  Normally, the \Condor{collector}
  and \Condor{negotiator} would run on the same machine.  If for some
  reason they weren't, \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} would not be needed.  Some
  of the host-based security macros use \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} by
  default.  See section~\ref{sec:Host-Security} on ``Setting up
  IP/host-based security in Condor'' for details.
  
\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_HOST}] \label{param:CollectorHost} The
  hostname of the machine where the \Condor{collector} is running for
  your pool.  Normally it would just be defined with the
  \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} macro described above.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST}] \label{param:NegotiatorHost} The
  hostname of the machine where the \Condor{negotiator} is running for
  your pool.  Normally it would just be defined with the
  \Macro{CONDOR\_HOST} macro described above.

\item[\Macro{RELEASE\_DIR}] \label{param:ReleaseDir} The full path to
  the Condor release directory, which holds the bin, etc, lib, and
  sbin directories.  Other macros are defined relative to this one.

\item[\Macro{BIN}] \label{param:Bin} This directory points to the
  Condor bin directory, where user-level programs are installed.  It
  is usually just defined relative to the \Macro{RELEASE\_DIR} macro.
  
\item[\Macro{LIB}] \label{param:Lib} This directory points to the
  Condor lib directory, where libraries used to link jobs for Condor's
  standard universe are stored.  The \Condor{compile} program uses
  this macro to find these libraries, so it must be defined.
  \Macro{LIB} is usually just defined relative to the
  \Macro{RELEASE\_DIR} macro.

\item[\Macro{SBIN}] \label{param:Sbin} This directory points to the
  Condor sbin directory, where Condor's system binaries (such as the
  binaries for the Condor daemons) and administrative tools are
  installed.  Whatever directory \Macro{SBIN} points to should
  probably be in the \Env{PATH} of anyone who is acting as a Condor
  administrator.

\item[\Macro{LOCAL\_DIR}] \label{param:LocalDir} The location of the
  local Condor directory on each machine in your pool.  One common
  option is to use the condor user's home directory which you could
  specify with \MacroU{tilde}.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(tilde)
\end{verbatim}
  
  On machines with a shared filesystem, where either the
  \MacroU{tilde} directory or another directory you want to use is
  shared among all machines in your pool, you might use the
  \MacroU{hostname} macro and have a directory with many
  subdirectories, one for each machine in your pool, each named by
  hostnames.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(tilde)/hosts/$(hostname)      
\end{verbatim}

  or:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(release_dir)/hosts/$(hostname)
\end{verbatim}

  
\item[\Macro{LOG}] \label{param:Log} This entry is used to specify the
  directory where each Condor daemon writes its log files.  The names
  of the log files themselves are defined with other macros, which use
  the \Macro{LOG} macro by default.  The log directory also acts as
  the current working directory of the Condor daemons as the run, so
  if one of them should drop a core file for any reason, it would wind
  up in the directory defined by this macro.  Normally, \Macro{LOG} is
  just defined in terms of \MacroU{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{SPOOL}] \label{param:Spool} The spool directory is where
  certain files used by the \Condor{schedd} are stored, such as the
  job queue file, and the initial executables of any jobs that have
  been submitted.  In addition, if you are not using a checkpoint
  server, all the checkpoint files from jobs that have been submitted
  from a given machine will be store in that machine's spool
  directory.  Therefore, you will want to ensure that the spool
  directory is located on a partition with enough disk space.  If a
  given machine is only setup to execute Condor jobs and not submit
  them, it would not need a spool directory (or this macro defined).
  Normally, \Macro{SPOOL} is just defined in terms of
  \MacroU{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{EXECUTE}] \label{param:Execute} This directory acts as
  the current working directory of any Condor job that is executing on
  the local machine.  If a given machine is only setup to only submit
  jobs and not execute them, it would not need an execute directory
  (or this macro defined).  Normally, \Macro{EXECUTE} is just defined
  in terms of \MacroU{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE}] \label{param:LocalConfigFile} The
  location of the local, machine-specific config file for each machine
  in your pool.  The two most common options would be putting this
  file in the \MacroU{LOCAL\_DIR} you just defined, or putting all
  local config files for your pool in a shared directory, each one
  named by hostname.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(LOCAL_DIR)/condor_config.local
\end{verbatim}
  
  or:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(release_dir)/etc/$(hostname).local
\end{verbatim}
  
  or, not using your release directory:

\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = /full/path/to/configs/$(hostname).local
\end{verbatim}
  
  Begining with Condor version 6.0.1, the \Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE}
  is treated as a list of files, not a single file.  So, you can use
  either a comma or space seperated list of files as its value.  This
  allows you to specify multiple files as the ``local config file''
  and each one will be processed in order (with parameters set in
  later files overridding values from previous files).  This allows
  you use one global config file for multiple platforms in your pool,
  define a platform-specific config file for each platform, and
  finally use a local config file for each machine.  For more
  information on this, see section~\ref{sec:Multiple-Platforms} on
  ``Configuring Condor for Multiple Platforms'' on
  page~\pageref{sec:Multiple-Platforms}.

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN}] \label{param:CondorAdmin} This is the email
  address that Condor will send mail to when something goes wrong in
  your pool.  For example, if a daemon crashes, the \Condor{master}
  can send an \Term{obituary} to this address with the last few lines
  of that daemon's log file and a brief message that describes what
  signal or exit status that daemon exited with.
  
\item[\Macro{MAIL}] \label{param:Mail} This is the full path to a mail
  sending program that understands that ``-s'' means you wish to
  specify a subject to the message you're sending.  On all platforms,
  the default shipped with Condor should work.  Only if you have
  installed things in a non-standard location on your system would you
  need to change this setting.
  
\item[\Macro{RESERVED\_SWAP}] \label{param:ReservedSwap} This setting
  determines how much swap space you want to reserve for your own
  machine.  Condor will not start up more \Condor{shadow} processes if
  the amount of free swap space on your machine falls below this
  level. 

\item[\Macro{RESERVED\_DISK}] \label{param:ReservedDisk} This setting
  determines how much disk space you want to reserve for your own
  machine.  When Condor is reporting the amount of free disk space in
  a given partition on your machine, it will always subtract this
  amount.  For example, the \Condor{startd} advertises the amount of
  free space in the \Macro{EXECUTE} directory described above.
  
\item[\Macro{LOCK}] \label{param:Lock} Condor needs to create a few
  lock files to synchronize access to various log files.  Because of
  problems we've had with network filesystems and file locking over
  the years, we \textbf{highly} recommend that you put these lock
  files on a local partition on each machine.  If you don't have your
  \Macro{LOCAL\_DIR} on a local partition, be sure to change this
  entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is running as needs to have
  write access to this directory.  If you're not running as root, this
  is whatever user you started up the \Condor{master} as.  If you are
  running as root, and there's a condor account, it's probably condor.
  Otherwise, it's whatever you've set in the \Env{CONDOR\_IDS}
  environment variable.  See section~\ref{sec:uids} on ``UIDs in
  Condor'' for details on this.

\item[\Macro{HISTORY}] \label{param:History} This entry defines the
  location of the Condor history file, which stores information about
  all Condor jobs that have completed on a given machine.  This entry
  is used by both the \Condor{schedd} which appends the information,
  and \Condor{history}, the user-level program that is used to view
  the history file.

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME}] \label{param:DefaultDomainName}
  If you don't use a fully qualified name in your \File{/etc/hosts}
  file (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an
  alias, Condor wouldn't normally be able to use fully qualified names
  in places that it'd like to.  You can set this parameter to the
  domain you'd like appended to your hostname, if changing your host
  information isn't a good option.  This parameter must be set in the
  global config file (not the \Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} specified
  above.  The reason for this is that the \Macro{FULL\_HOSTNAME}
  special macro is used by the config file code in Condor which needs
  to know the full hostname.  So, for \Macro{DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME} to
  take effect, Condor must already have read in its value.  However,
  Condor must set the \Macro{FULL\_HOSTNAME} special macro since you
  might use that to define where your local config file is.  So, after
  reading the global config file, Condor figures out the right values
  for \Macro{HOSTNAME} and \Macro{FULL\_HOSTNAME} and inserts them
  into its configuration table.

\item[\Macro{CREATE\_CORE\_FILES}] \label{param:CreateCoreFiles}
  Condor can be told whether or not you want the Condor daemons to
  create a core file if something really bad happens.  This just sets
  the resource limit for the size of a core file.  By default, we
  don't do anything, and leave in place whatever limit was in effect
  when you started the Condor daemons (normally the \Condor{master}).
  If this parameter is set and "True", we increase the limit to as
  large as it gets.  If it's set to "False", we set the limit at 0
  (which means that no core files are even created).  Core files
  greatly help the Condor developers debug any problems you might be
  having.  By using the parameter, you don't have to worry about
  tracking down where in your boot scripts you need to set the core
  limit before starting Condor, etc.  You can just set the parameter
  to whatever behavior you want Condor to enforce.  This parameter has
  no default value, and is commented out in the default config file. 

\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Daemon-Logging-Config-File-Entries}
Daemon Logging Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These entries control how and where the Condor daemons write their log
files.  All of these entries are named with the subsystem (as
described in section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names} above) of the daemon
you wish to control logging for.

\begin{description}
 
\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_LOG}] \label{param:SubsysLog} This is the name of
  the log file for the given subsystem.  For example,
  \Macro{STARTD\_LOG} gives the location of the log file for the
  \Condor{startd}.  These entries are defined relative to the
  \Macro{LOG} macro described above.  The actual names of the files
  are also used in the \Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry used by
  \Condor{preen}, which is described below.  If you change one of the
  filenames with this setting, be sure to change the
  \Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry as well, or \Condor{preen} will
  delete your newly named log files.  
  
\item[\Macro{MAX\_SUBSYS\_LOG}] \label{param:MaxSubsysLog} This
  setting controls the maximum length in bytes to which the various
  logs will be allowed to grow.  Each log file will grow to the
  specified length, then be saved to a ``.old'' file.  The ``.old''
  files are overwritten each time the log is saved, thus the maximum
  space devoted to logging for any one program will be twice the
  maximum length of its log file.

\item[\Macro{TRUNC\_SUBSYS\_LOG\_ON\_OPEN}]
  \label{param:TruncSubsysLogOnOpen}  If this macro is defined and set
  to ``True'' the affected log will be truncated and started from an
  empty file with each invocation of the program.  Otherwise, new
  invocations of the program will simply append to the previous log
  file.  By default this setting is turned off for all daemons. 

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}] \label{param:SubsysDebug} All of the
  Condor daemons can produce different levels of output depending on
  how much information you want to see.  The various levels of
  verbosity for a given daemon are determined by this entry.  All
  daemons have a default level, \Dflag{ALWAYS}, and log message for
  that level will be printed to the daemon's log, regardless of what
  you have set here.  The other possible debug levels are:

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Dflag{FULLDEBUG}] \label{dflag:fulldebug} Generally, turning on
  this setting provides very verbose output in the log files.

\item[\Dflag{DAEMONCORE}] \label{dflag:daemoncore} This provides log
  file entries for things that are specific to DaemonCore, such as
  timers the daemons have set, the commands that are registered, and
  so on.  If both \Dflag{FULLDEBUG} and \Dflag{DAEMONCORE} are set,
  you get \textbf{VERY} verbose output.

\item[\Dflag{PRIV}] \label{dflag:priv} This flag provides turns on log
  messages about the \Term{privilege state} switching that the daemons
  do.  See section~\ref{sec:uids} on UIDs in Condor for more details.

\item[\Dflag{COMMAND}] \label{dflag:command} With this flag set, a
  Any daemon that uses DaemonCore will print out a log message
  whenever a command comes in.  The name and integer of the command
  are printed, whether the command was sent via UDP or TCP, and where
  the command was sent from.  Because the \Condor{kbdd} works by
  sending UDP commands to the \Condor{startd} whenever there is
  activity on the X server, we don't recommend turning on
  \Dflag{COMMAND} login in the \Condor{startd}, since you will get so
  many messages that the log file will be fairly useless to you.  On
  platforms that use the \Condor{kbdd}, this is turned off in the
  \Condor{startd} by default.

\item[\Dflag{LOAD}] \label{dflag:load} The \Condor{startd} keeps track
  of the load average on the machine where it is running.  Both the
  general system load average, and the load average being generated by
  Condor's activity there.  With this flag set, the \Condor{startd}
  will print out a log message with the current state of both of these
  load averages whenever it computes them.  This flag only effects the
  \Condor{startd}.
  
\item[\Dflag{JOB}] \label{dflag:job} When this flag is set, the
  \Condor{startd} will dump out to its log file the contents of any
  job ClassAd that the \Condor{schedd} sends to claim the
  \Condor{startd} for its use.  This flag only effects the
  \Condor{startd}.
  
\item[\Dflag{MACHINE}] \label{dflag:machine} When this flag is set,
  the \Condor{startd} will dump out to its log file the contents of
  its resource ClassAd when the \Condor{schedd} tries to claim the
  \Condor{startd} for its use.  This flag only effects the
  \Condor{startd}.

\item[\Dflag{SYSCALLS}] \label{dflag:syscalls} This flag is used to
  make the \Condor{shadow} log remote syscall requests and return
  values.  This can help track down problems a user is having with a
  particular job since you can see what system calls the job is
  performing, which, if any, are failing, and what the reason for the
  failure is.  The \Condor{schedd} also uses this flag for the server
  portion of the queue management code.  So, with \Dflag{SYSCALLS}
  defined in \Macro{SCHEDD\_DEBUG} you will see verbose logging of all
  queue management operations the \Condor{schedd} performs.

\subsection{\label{sec:DaemonCore-Config-File-Entries}
DaemonCore Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Please read section~\ref{sec:DaemonCore} on ``DaemonCore'' for details
about DaemonCore is.  There are certain config file settings that
DaemonCore uses which affect all Condor daemons (except the checkpoint
server, shadow, and starter, none of which use DaemonCore yet).

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{HOSTALLOW\Dots}] \label{param:HostAllow} All of the
  settings that begin with either \Macro{HOSTALLOW} or
  \Macro{HOSTDENY} are settings for Condor's host-based security.
  Please see section~\ref{sec:Host-Security} on ``Setting up
  IP/host-based security in Condor'' for details on all of these
  settings and how to configure them.

\item[\Macro{SHUTDOWN\_GRACEFUL\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:ShutdownGracefulTimeout} This entry determines how long
  you are willing to let daemons try their graceful shutdown methods
  before they do a hard shutdown.  It is defined in terms of seconds.
  The default is 1800 (30 minutes).

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE}]
  \label{param:SubsysAddressFile} Every Condor daemon that uses
  DaemonCore has a command port where commands can be sent.  The
  IP/port of the daemon is put in that daemon's ClassAd so that other
  machines in the pool can query the \Condor{collector} (which listens
  on a well-known port) to find the address of a given daemon on a
  given machine.  However, tools and daemons executing on the same
  machine they wish to communicate with don't have to query the
  collector, they can simply look in a file on the local disk to find
  the IP/port.  Setting this entry will cause daemons to write the
  IP/port of their command socket to the file you specify.  This way,
  local tools will continue to operate, even if the machine running
  the \Condor{collector} crashes.  Using this file will also generate
  slightly less network traffic in your pool (since \Condor{q},
  \Condor{rm}, etc won't have to send any messages over the network to
  locate the \Condor{schedd}, for example).  This entry is not needed
  for the collector or negotiator, since their command sockets are at
  well-known ports anyway.  
  
\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}] \label{param:SubsysExprs} This entry
  allows you to have the any DaemonCore daemon advertise arbitrary
  expressions from the config file in its ClassAd.  Give the
  comma-separated list of entries from the config file you want in the
  given daemon's ClassAd.
  
  \Note The \Condor{negotiator} and \Condor{kbdd} do not send
  ClassAds now, so this entry does not effect them at all.  The
  \Condor{startd}, \Condor{schedd}, \Condor{master}, and
  \Condor{collector} do send ClassAds, so those would be valid
  subsystems to set this entry for.
  
  \textbf{OTHER NOTE:} Setting \Macro{SUBMIT\_EXPRS} has the slightly
  different effect of having the named expressions inserted into all
  the job ClassAds that \Condor{submit} creates.  This is equivalent
  to the ``+'' syntax in submit files.  See the
  \Cmd{\condor{submit}}{1} man page for details.  

  \textbf{OTHER NOTE:} Because of the different syntax of the config
  file and ClassAds, you might have to do a little extra work to get a
  given entry into the ClassAd.  In particular, ClassAds require quote
  marks (") around your strings.  Numeric values can go in directly,
  as can expressions or boolean macros.  For example, if you wanted
  the startd to advertise a macro that was a string, a numeric macro,
  and a boolean expression, you'd have to do something like the
  following:

\begin{verbatim}
        STRING_MACRO = This is a string macro
        NUMBER_MACRO = 666
        BOOL_MACRO = True
        EXPR : CurrentTime >= $(NUMBER_MACRO) || $(BOOL_MACRO)
        MY_STRING_MACRO = "$(STRING_MACRO)"
        STARTD_EXPRS = MY_STRING_MACRO, NUMBER_MACRO, BOOL_MACRO, EXPR
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\label{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries}
Shared Filesystem Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These entries control how Condor interacts with various shared and
network filesystems.  If you are using AFS as your shared filesystem,
be sure to read section~\ref{sec:Condor-AFS} on ``Using Condor with
AFS''

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:UidDomain} Often times,
  especially if all the machines in the pool are administered by the
  same organization, all the machines to be added into a Condor pool
  share the same login account information.  Specifically, does user X
  have UID Y on all machines within a given Internet/DNS domain? This
  is usually the case if a central authority creates user logins and
  maintains a common /etc/passwd file on all machines (perhaps via
  NIS/Yellow Pages, distributing the passwd file, etc). If this is the
  case, then set this macro to the name of the Internet/DNS domain
  where this is true. For instance, if all the machines in this Condor
  pool within the Internet/DNS zone ``cs.wisc.edu'' have a common
  passwd file, \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} would be set to ``cs.wisc.edu''. If
  this is not the case you can comment out the entry and Condor will
  automatically use the fully qualified hostname of each machine.  If
  you put in a ``*'', that means a wildcard to match all domains and
  therefore to honor all UIDs - dangerous idea.
          
  Condor uses this information to determine if it should run a given
  Condor job on the remote execute machine with the UID of whomever
  submitted the job or with the UID of user ``nobody''.  If you set
  this to ``none'' or don't set it at all, then Condor jobs will
  always execute with the access permissions of user ``nobody''.  For
  security purposes, it is not a bad idea to have Condor jobs that
  migrate around on machines across an entire organization to run as
  user ``nobody'', which by convention has very restricted access to
  the disk files of a machine.  Standard Universe Condor jobs are
  perfectly happy to run as user nobody since all I/O is redirected
  back via remote system calls to a shadow process running on the
  submit machine which is authenticated as the user.  If you only plan
  on running Standard Universe jobs, then it is a good idea to simply
  set this to ``none'' or don't define it.  Vanilla Universe jobs,
  however, cannot take advantage of Condor's remote system calls.
  Vanilla Universe jobs are dependent upon NFS, RFS, AFS, or some
  shared filesystem setup to read/write files as they bounce around
  from machine to machine. If you want to run Vanilla jobs and your
  shared filesystems are via AFS, then you can safely leave this as
  ``none'' as well. But if you wish to use Vanilla jobs with Condor
  and you have shared filesystems via NFS or RFS, then you should
  enter in a legitimate domain name where all your UIDs match (you
  should be doing this with NFS anyway!) on all machines in the pool,
  or else users in your pool who submit Vanilla jobs will have to make
  their files world read/write (so that user nobody can access them).
          
  Some gritty details for folks who want to know: If the submitting
  machine and the remote machine about to execute the job both have
  the same login name in the passwd file for a given UID, and the
  \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} claimed by the submit machine is indeed found to
  be a subset of what an inverse lookup to a DNS (domain name server)
  or NIS reports as the fully qualified domain name for the submit
  machine's IP address (this security measure safeguards against the
  submit machine from simply lying), \textbf{THEN} the job will run
  with the same UID as the user who submitted the job.  Otherwise it
  will run as user ``nobody''.
          
  Note: the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} parameter is also used when Condor
  sends email back to the user about a completed job; the address
  \texttt{Job-Owner@UID\_DOMAIN} is used, unless \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}
  is ``none'', in which case \texttt{Job-Owner@submit-machine} is
  used.
  
\item[\Macro{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:SoftUidDomain} This
  setting is used in conjuction with the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} setting
  described above.  If the \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} settings match on both
  the execute and submit machines, but the uid of the user who
  submitted the job isn't in the passwd file (or password info if NIS
  is being used) of the execute machine, the \Condor{starter} will
  normally exit with an error.  If you set \Macro{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN}
  to be ``True'', Condor will simply start the job with the specified
  uid, even if it's not in the passwd file.

\item[\Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:FilesystemDomain} This
  setting is similar in concept to \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}, but here we
  need the Internet/DNS domain name where all the machines within that
  domain can access the same set of NFS file servers.  
          
  Often times, especially if all the machines in the pool are
  administered by the same organization, all the machines to be added
  into a Condor pool can mount the same set of NFS fileservers onto
  the same place in the directory tree.  Specifically, do all the
  machines in the pool within a specific Internet/DNS domain mount the
  same set of NFS file servers onto the same path mount-points?  If
  this is the case, then set this macro to the name of the
  Internet/DNS domain where this is true.  For instance, if all the
  machines in the Condor pool within the Internet/DNS zone
  ``cs.wisc.edu'' have a common passwd file and mount the same volumes
  from the same NFS servers, set \Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} to
  ``cs.wisc.edu''.  If this is not the case you can comment out the
  entry, and Condor will automatically set it to the fully qualified
  hostname of the local machine.
  
\item[\Macro{HAS\_AFS}] \label{param:HasAfs} Set this to ``True'' if
  all the machines you plan on adding in your pool all can access a
  common set of AFS fileservers.  Otherwise, set it to ``False''.
      
\item[\Macro{FS\_PATHNAME}] \label{param:FsPathname} If you're using
  AFS, Condor needs to know where the AFS ``fs'' command is located so
  that it can verify the AFS cell-names of machines in the pool.  The
  default value of \File{/usr/afsws/bin/fs} is also the default that
  AFS uses.
  
\item[\Macro{VOS\_PATHNAME}] \label{param:VosPathname} If you're using
  AFS, Condor needs to know where the AFS ``vos'' command is located
  so that it can compare fileserver names of volumes.  The default
  value of \File{/usr/afsws/etc/vos} is also the default that AFS
  uses. 

\item[\Macro{RESERVE\_AFS\_CACHE}] \label{param:ReserveAfsCache} If
  your machine is running AFS and the AFS cache lives on the same
  partition as the other Condor directories, and you want Condor to
  reserve the space that your AFS cache is configured to use, set this
  entry to ``True''.  It defaults to ``False''.
  
\item[\Macro{USE\_NFS}] \label{param:UseNfs} This setting influences
  how Condor jobs running in the Standard Universe will access their
  files.  Condor will normally always redirect the file I/O requests
  of Standard Universe jobs back to be executed on the machine which
  submitted the job.  Because of this, as a Condor job migrates around
  the network, the filesystem always appears to be identical to the
  filesystem where the job was submitted.  However, consider the case
  where a user's data files are sitting on an NFS server. The machine
  running the user's program will send all I/O over the network to the
  machine which submitted the job, which in turn sends all the I/O
  over the network a second time back to the NFS file server. Thus,
  all of the program's I/O is being sent over the network twice.
          
  If you set this macro to ``True'', then Condor will attempt to
  read/write files without redirecting them back to the submitting
  machine if both the submitting machine and the machine running the
  job are both accessing the same NFS servers (if they're both in the
  same \Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}, as described above).  The result is
  I/O performed by Condor Standard Universe programs is only sent over
  the network once.  
          
  While sending all file operations over the network twice might sound
  really bad, unless you are operating over networks where bandwidth
  as at a very high premium, practical experience reveals that this
  scheme offers very little real performance gain.  There are also
  some (fairly rare) situations where this scheme can break down.
  
  Setting \Macro{USE\_NFS} to ``False'' is always safe.  It may result
  in slightly more network traffic, but Condor jobs are ideally heavy
  on CPU and light on I/O anyway.  It also ensures that a remote
  Standard Universe Condor job will always use Condor's remote system
  calls mechanism to reroute I/O and therefore see the exact same
  filesystem that the user sees on the machine where she/he submitted
  the job.
  
  Some gritty details for folks who want to know: If the you set
  \Macro{USE\_NFS} to ``True'', and the \Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} of
  both the submitting machine and the remote machine about to execute
  the job match, and the \Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} claimed by the
  submit machine is indeed found to be a subset of what an inverse
  lookup to a DNS (domain name server) reports as the fully qualified
  domain name for the submit machine's IP address (this security
  measure safeguards against the submit machine from simply lying),
  \textbf{THEN} the job will access files via a local system call,
  without redirecting them to the submitting machine (a.k.a. with
  NFS).  Otherwise, the system call will get routed back to the
  submitting machine via Condor's remote system call mechanism.
  
\item[\Macro{USE\_AFS}] \label{param:UseAfs} If your machines have AFS
  and the submit and execute machines are in the same AFS cell, this
  setting determines whether Condor will use remote system calls for
  Standard Universe jobs to send I/O requests to the submit machine,
  or if it should use local file access on the execute machine (which
  will then use AFS to get to the submitter's files).  Read the
  setting above on \Macro{USE\_NFS} for a discussion of why you might
  want to use AFS access instead of remote system calls.
  
  One important difference between \Macro{USE\_NFS} and
  \Macro{USE\_AFS} is the AFS cache.  With \Macro{USE\_AFS} set to
  ``True'', the remote Condor job executing on some machine will start
  messing with the AFS cache, possibly evicting the machine owner's
  files from the cache to make room for its own.  Generally speaking,
  since we try to minimize the impact of having a Condor job run on a
  given machine, we don't recomend using this setting.

  While sending all file operations over the network twice might sound
  really bad, unless you are operating over networks where bandwidth
  as at a very high premium, practical experience reveals that this
  scheme offers very little real performance gain.  There are also
  some (fairly rare) situations where this scheme can break down.
  
  Setting \Macro{USE\_AFS} to ``False'' is always safe.  It may result
  in slightly more network traffic, but Condor jobs are ideally heavy
  on CPU and light on I/O anyway.  ``False'' ensures that a remote
  Standard Universe Condor job will always see the exact same
  filesystem that the user on sees on the machine where he/she
  submitted the job.  Plus, it will ensure that the machine where the
  job executes doesn't have its AFS cache screwed up as a result of
  the Condor job being there.  
  
  However, things may be different at your site, which is why the
  setting is there.

\subsection{\label{sec:Checkpoint-Server-Config-File-Entries}
Checkpoint Server Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These entries control whether or not Condor user a checkpoint server.
In addition, if you are using a checkpoint server, this section
describes the settings that the checkpoint server itself needs to have
defined.  If you decide to use a checkpoint server, you must install
it seperately (it is not included in the main Condor binary
distribution or installation procedure).  See
section~\ref{sec:Ckpt-Server} on ``Installing a Checkpoint Server''
for details on installing and running a checkpoint server for your
pool.

\Note If you are setting up a machine to join to UW-Madison CS
Department Condor pool, you \textbf{should} configure the machine to
use a checkpoint server, and use ``condor-ckpt.cs.wisc.edu'' as the
checkpoint server host (see below).

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{USE\_CKPT\_SERVER}] \label{param:UseCkptServer} A boolean
  which determines if you want a given machine machine to use the
  checkpoint server for your pool.  

\item[\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST}] \label{param:CkptServerHost} The
  hostname of the checkpoint server for your pool.  
  
\item[\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_DIR}] \label{param:CkptServerDir} The
  checkpoint server needs this macro defined to the full path of the
  directory the server should use to store checkpoint files.
  Depending on the size of your pool and the size of the jobs your
  users are submitting, this directory (and it's subdirectories) might
  need to store many megabytes of data.

\subsection{\label{sec:Master-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{master} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control the \Condor{master}.

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}] \label{param:DaemonList} This macro
  determines what daemons the \Condor{master} will start and keep its
  watchful eyes on.  The list is a comma or space seperated list of
  subsystem names (described above in
  section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}).  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
        DAEMON_LIST = MASTER, STARTD, SCHEDD
\end{verbatim}

  \Note On your central manager, your \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}
  will be different from your regular pool, since it will include
  entries for the \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator}.  
  
  \Note On machines running Digital Unix or IRIX, your
  \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST} will also include ``KBDD'', for the
  \Condor{kbdd}, which is a special daemon that runs to monitor
  keyboard and mouse activity on the console.  It is only with this
  special daemon that we can aquire this information on those
  platforms. 

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS}] \label{param:SUBSYS} Once you have defined which
  subsystems you want the \Condor{master} to start, you must provide
  it with the full path to each of these binaries.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
        MASTER          = $(SBIN)/condor_master
        STARTD          = $(SBIN)/condor_startd
        SCHEDD          = $(SBIN)/condor_schedd
\end{verbatim}

  Generally speaking, these would be defined relative to the
  \Macro{SBIN} macro.
  
\item[\Macro{PREEN}] \label{param:Preen} In addition to the daemons
  defined in \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}, the \Condor{master} also starts up
  a special process, \Condor{preen} to clean out junk files that have
  been left lying around by Condor.  This macro determines where the
  \Condor{master} finds the preen binary.  It also controls how
  \Condor{preen} behaves by the command-line arguments you pass to
  ``-m'' means you want email about files \Condor{preen} finds that it
  thinks it should remove.  ``-r'' means you want \Condor{preen} to
  actually remove these files.  If you don't want preen to run at all,
  just comment out this setting.

\item[\Macro{PREEN\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:PreenInterval} This macro
  determines how often \Condor{preen} should be started.  It is
  defined in terms of seconds and defaults to 86400 (once a day).

\item[\Macro{PUBLISH\_OBITUARIES}] \label{param:PublishObituaries}
  When a daemon crashes, the \Condor{master} can send email to the
  address specified by \Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN} with an obituary letting
  the administrator know that the daemon died, what it's cause of
  death was (which signal or exit status it exited with), and
  (optionally) the last few entries from that daemon's log file.  If
  you want these obituaries, set this entry to ``True''.

\item[\Macro{OBITUARY\_LOG\_LENGTH}] \label{param:ObituaryLogLength}
  If you're getting obituaries, this setting controls how many lines
  of the log file you want to see.

\item[\Macro{START\_MASTER}] \label{param:StartMaster} If this setting
  is defined and set to ``False'' when the master starts up, the first
  thing it will do is exit.  This may seem strange, but perhaps you
  just don't want Condor to run on certain machines in your pool, yet
  the boot scripts for your entire pool are handled by a centralized
  system that starts up the \Condor{master} automatically.  This is
  certainly an entry you'd most likely find in a local config file,
  not your global config file.

\item[\Macro{START\_DAEMONS}] \label{param:StartDaemons} This setting
  is similar to the \Macro{START\_MASTER} macro described above.
  However, the \Condor{master} doesn't exit, it just doesn't start any
  of the daemons listed in the \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}.  This way, you
  could start up the daemons at some later time with a \Condor{on}
  command if you wished.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterUpdateInterval} This entry determines how often
  the \Condor{master} sends a ClassAd update to the
  \Condor{collector}.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 300
  (every 5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{MASTER\_CHECK\_NEW\_EXEC\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterCheckNewExecInterval} This
  setting controls how often the \Condor{master} checks the timestamps
  of the daemons it's running.  If any daemons have been modified, the
  master restarts them.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 300
  (every 5 minutes).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_NEW\_BINARY\_DELAY}]
  \label{param:MasterNewBinaryDelay} Once the \Condor{master} has
  discovered a new binary, this macro controls how long it waits
  before attempting to execute the new binary.  This delay is here
  because the \Condor{master} might notice a new binary while you're
  in the process of copying in new binaries and the entire file might
  not be there yet (in which case trying to execute it could yield
  unpredictable results).  The entry is defined in seconds and
  defaults to 120 (2 minutes).

\item[\Macro{SHUTDOWN\_FAST\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:ShutdownFastTimeout} This macro determines the maximum
  amount of time you're willing to give the daemons to perform their
  fast shutdown procedure before the \Condor{master} just kills them
  outright.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 120 (2 minutes).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR}]
  \label{param:MasterBackoffFactor} If a daemon keeps crashing, we
  use \Term{exponential backoff} so we wait longer and longer before
  restarting it.  At the end of this section, there is an example that
  shows how all these settings work.  This setting is the base of the
  exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting the
  daemon again.  It defaults to 2.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_CEILING}]
  \label{param:MasterBackoffCeiling} This entry determines the maximum
  amount of time you want the master to wait between attempts to start
  a given daemon.  (With 2.0 as the \Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR},
  you'd hit 1 hour in 12 restarts).  This is defined in terms of
  seconds and defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_RECOVER\_FACTOR}]
  \label{param:MasterRecoverFactor}  How long should a daemon run
  without crashing before we consider it \Term{recovered}.  Once a
  daemon has recovered, we reset the number of restarts so the
  exponential backoff stuff goes back to normal.  This is defined in
  terms of seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

\end{description}

Just for clarity, here's a little example of how all these exponential
backoff settings work.  The example is worked out in terms of the
default settings.

When a daemon crashes, it is restarted in 10 seconds.  If it keeps
crashing, we wait longer and longer before restarting it based on how
many times it's been restarted.  We take the number of times the
daemon has restarted, take the \Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR}
(defaults to 2) to that power, and add 9.  Sounds complicated, but
here's how it works:

\begin{verbatim}
        1st crash:  restarts == 0, so, 9 + 2^0 = 9 + 1 = 10 seconds
        2nd crash:  restarts == 1, so, 9 + 2^1 = 9 + 2 = 11 seconds
        3rd crash:  restarts == 2, so, 9 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 seconds
        ...
        6th crash:  restarts == 5, so, 9 + 2^5 = 9 + 32 = 41 seconds
        ...
        9th crash:  restarts == 8, so, 9 + 2^8 = 9 + 256 = 265 seconds
\end{verbatim}

If the daemon kept dying and restarting, after the 13th crash, you'd
have:

\begin{verbatim}
        13th crash:  restarts == 12, so, 9 + 2^12 = 9 + 4096 = 4105 seconds
\end{verbatim}

This is bigger than the \Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_CEILING}, which
defaults to 3600, so the daemon would really be restarted after only
3600 seconds, not 4105.  Assuming a few hours went by like this, with
the \Condor{master} trying again every hour (since the numbers would
get even more huge, but would always be capped by the ceiling).
Eventually, imagine that daemon finally started and didn't crash (for
example, after the email you got about the daemon crashing, you
realized that you had accidentally deleted its binary so you
reinstalled it).  If it stayed alive for
\Macro{MASTER\_RECOVER\_FACTOR} seconds (defaults to 5 minutes).  We'd
reset the count of how many restarts this daemon has performed.  So,
if 15 minutes later, it died again, it would be restarted in 10
seconds, not 1 hour.

The moral of the story is that this is some relatively complicated
stuff.  The defaults we have work quite well, and you probably 
won't want to change them for any reason.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_EXPRS}] \label{param:MasterExprs} This setting is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysExprs} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_DEBUG}] \label{param:MasterDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the master) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:MasterAddressFile}
  This setting is described above in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE} 

\end{description}

\subsection{\label{sec:Startd-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{startd} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control general operation of the \Condor{startd}.
Information on how to configure the \Condor{startd} to start, suspend,
resume, vacate and kill remote Condor jobs can be found in a separate
top-level section, section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on
``Configuring The Startd Policy''.  In there, you will find
information on the startd's \Term{states} and \Term{activities}.  If
you see entries in the config file that are not described here, it is
because they control state or activity transitions within the
\Condor{startd} and are described in
section`\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy}. 

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{STARTER}] \label{param:Starter}  This macro holds the full
  path to the regular \Condor{starter} binary the startd should
  spawn.  It is normally defined relative to \MacroU{SBIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{ALTERNATE\_STARTER\_1}] \label{param:AlternateStarter1}
  This macro holds the full path to the special \Condor{starter.pvm}
  binary the startd spawns to service PVM jobs.  It is normally
  defined relative to \MacroU{SBIN}, since by default,
  \Condor{starter.pvm} is installed in the regular Condor release
  directory. 
  
\item[\Macro{POLLING\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:PollingInterval} When a
  startd is claimed, this setting determines how often we should poll
  the state of the machine to see if we need to suspend, resume,
  vacate or kill the job.  Defined in terms of seconds and defaults to
  5.
  
\item[\Macro{UPDATE\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:UpdateInterval} This
  entry determines how often the startd should send a ClassAd update
  to the \Condor{collector}.  The startd also sends update on any
  state or activity change, or if the value of its START expression
  changes.  See section~\ref{sec:States} on ``\condor{startd}
  States'', section~\ref{sec:Activities} on ``\condor{startd}
  Activities'', and section~\ref{sec:Start-Expr} on ``\condor{startd}
  START expression'' for details on states, activities, and the
  \Expr{START} expression respectively.  This entry is defined in
  terms of seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{STARTD\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP}] \label{param:StartdHasBadUtmp}
  Normally, when the startd is computing the idle time of all the
  users of the machine (both local and remote), it checks the
  \File{utmp} file to find all the currently active ttys, and only
  checks access time of the devices associated with active logins.
  Unfortunately, on some systems, \File{utmp} is unreliable, and the
  startd might miss keyboard activity by doing this.  So, if your
  \File{utmp} is unreliable, set this setting to ``True'' and the
  startd will check the access time on all tty and pty devices.
  
\item[\Macro{CONSOLE\_DEVICES}] \label{param:ConsoleDevices} This
  macro allows the startd to monitor console (keyboard and mouse)
  activity by checking the access times on special files in
  \File{/dev}.  Activity on these files shows up as ``ConsoleIdle''
  time in the startd's ClassAd.  Just give a comma-separated list of
  the names of devices you want considered the console, without the
  ``\File{/dev/}'' portion of the pathname.  The defaults vary from
  platform to platform, and are usually correct.  

  One possible exception to this is that on Linux, we use ``mouse'' as
  one of the entries here.  Normally, Linux installations put in a
  soft link from \File{/dev/mouse} that points to the appropriate
  device (for example, \File{/dev/psaux} for a PS/2 bus mouse, or
  \File{/dev/tty00} for a serial mouse connected to com1).  However,
  if your installation doesn't have this soft link, you will either
  need to put it in (which you'll be glad you did), or change this
  setting to point to the right device. 
  
  Unfortunately, there are no such devices on Digital Unix or IRIX
  (don't be fooled by \File{/dev/keyboard0}, etc, the kernel does not
  update the access times on these devices) so this entry is not
  useful there, and we must use the \Condor{kbdd} to get this
  information by connecting to the X server.
  
\item[\Macro{STARTD\_JOB\_EXPRS}] \label{param:StartdJobExprs} When
  the startd is claimed by a remote user, it can also advertise
  arbitrary attributes from the ClassAd of the job its working on.
  Just list the attribute names you want advertised.  Note: since
  these are already ClassAd expressions, you don't have to do anything
  funny with strings, etc.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_EXPRS}] \label{param:StartdExprs} This setting is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysExprs} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_DEBUG}] \label{param:StartdDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the startd) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:StartdAddressFile}
  This setting is described above in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE}

\subsection{\label{sec:Schedd-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{schedd} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control the \Condor{schedd}.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{SHADOW}] \label{param:Shadow} This macro determines the
  full path of the \Condor{shadow} binary that the \Condor{schedd}
  spawns.  It is normally defined in terms of \MacroU{SBIN}. 
  
\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_PVM}] \label{param:ShadowPvm} This macro
  determines the full path of the special \Condor{shadow.pvm} binary
  used for supporting PVM jobs that the \Condor{schedd} spawns.  It is
  normally defined in terms of \MacroU{SBIN}.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_JOBS\_RUNNING}] \label{param:MaxJobsRunning} This
  setting controls the maximum number of \Condor{shadow} processes
  you're willing to let a given \Condor{schedd} spawn.  The actual
  number of \Condor{shadow}'s might be less than that if you reached
  your \Macro{RESERVED\_SWAP} limit.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_SHADOW\_EXCEPTIONS}]
  \label{param:MaxShadowExceptions} This setting controls the maximum
  number of times that a \Condor{shadow} processes can have a fatal
  error (exception) before the \Condor{schedd} will simply relinquish
  the match associated with the dying shadow.  Defaults to 5.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:ScheddInterval}  This
  entry determines how often the \Condor{schedd} should send a ClassAd
  update to the \Condor{collector}.  It is defined in terms of seconds
  and defaults to 300 (every 5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{JOB\_START\_DELAY}] \label{param:JobStartDelay} When the
  \Condor{schedd} has finished negotiating and has a lot of new
  \Condor{startd}'s that it has claimed, the \Condor{schedd} can wait
  a certain delay before starting up a \Condor{shadow} for each job
  it's going to run.  This prevents a sudden, large load on the submit
  machine as it spawns many shadows simultaneously, and having to deal
  with their startup activity all at once.  This macro determines how
  how long the \Condor{schedd} should wait in between spawning each
  \Condor{shadow}.  Defined in terms of seconds and defaults to 2. 
  
\item[\Macro{ALIVE\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:AliveInterval} This
  setting determines how often the schedd should send a keep alive
  message to any startd it has claimed.  When the schedd claims a
  startd, it tells the startd how often it's going to send these
  messages.  If the startd doesn't get one of these messages after 3
  of these intervals has passed, the startd releases the claim, and
  the schedd is no longer paying for the resource (in terms of
  priority in the system).  The macro is defined in terms of seconds
  and defaults to 300 (every 5 minutes).

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_SIZE\_ESTIMATE}] \label{param:ShadowSizeEstimate}
  This entry is the estimated virtual memory size of each
  \Condor{shadow} process.  Specified in kilobytes.  The default
  varies from platform to platform.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}]
  \label{param:ShadowReniceIncrement} When the schedd spawns a new
  \Condor{shadow}, it can do so with a \Term{nice-level}.  This is a
  mechanism in UNIX where you can assign your own processes a lower 
  priority so that they don't interfere with interactive use of the
  machine.  This is very handy for keeping a submit machine with lots
  of shadows running still useful to the owner of the machine.  The
  entry can be any integer between 1 and 19.  It defaults to 10.

\item[\Macro{QUEUE\_CLEAN\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:QueueCleanInterval}
  The schedd maintains the job queue on a given machine.  It does so
  in a persistent way such that if the schedd crashes, it can recover
  a valid state of the job queue.  The mechanism it uses is a
  transaction-based log file (this is the \File{job\_queue.log} file,
  not the \File{SchedLog} file).  This file contains some initial
  state of the job queue, and a series of transactions that were
  performed on the queue (such as new jobs submitted, jobs completing,
  checkpointing, whatever).  Periodically, the schedd will go through
  this log, truncate all the transactions and create a new file with
  just the new initial state of the log.  This is a somewhat expensive
  operation, but it speeds up when the schedd restarts since there are
  less transactions it has to play to figure out what state the job
  queue is really in.  This macro determines how often the schedd
  should to this ``queue cleaning''.  It is defined in terms of
  seconds and defaults to 86400 (once a day). 
  
\item[\Macro{ALLOW\_REMOTE\_SUBMIT}] \label{param:AllowRemoteSubmit}
  Starting with Condor Version 6.0, users can run \Condor{submit} on
  one machine and actually submit jobs to another machine in the
  pool.  This is called a \Term{remote submit}.  Jobs submitted in
  this way are entered into the job queue owned by user ``nobody''.
  This entry determines whether you want to allow such a thing to
  happen to a given schedd.  It defaults to ``False''.
     
\item[\Macro{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS}] \label{param:QueueSuperUsers} This
  macro determines what usernames on a given machine have
  \Term{super-user access} to your job queue, meaning that they can
  modify or delete the job ClassAds of other users.  (Normally, you
  can only modify or delete ClassAds that you own from the job queue).
  Whatever username corresponds with the UID that Condor is running as
  (usually ``condor'') will automatically get included in this list
  because that is needed for Condor's proper functioning.  See
  section~\ref{sec:uids} on ``UIDs in Condor'' for more details on
  this.  By default, we give ``root'' the ability to remove other
  user's jobs, in addition to user ``condor''.
      
\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_LOCK}] \label{param:ScheddLock} This entry
  specifies what lock file should be used for access to the
  \File{SchedLog} file.  It must be a separate file from the
  \File{SchedLog}, since the \File{SchedLog} may be rotated and you
  want to be able to synchronize access across log file rotations.
  This macro is defined relative to the \Macro{LOCK} macro described
  above.  If, for some strange reason, you decide to change this
  setting, be sure to change the \Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry that
  \Condor{preen} uses as well.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPRS}] \label{param:ScheddExprs} This setting is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysExprs} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ScheddDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the schedd) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:ScheddAddressFile}
  This setting is described above in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE} 

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Shadow-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{shadow} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This setting effects the \Condor{shadow}

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{MAX\_DISCARDED\_RUN\_TIME}]
  \label{param:MaxDiscardedRunTime} If the shadow is unable to read a
  checkpoint file from the checkpoint server, it keeps trying only if
  the job has accumulated more than this many seconds of CPU usage.
  Otherwise, the job is started from scratch.  Defaults to 3600 (1
  hour). This setting is only used if \Macro{USE\_CKPT\_SERVER} is
  True.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_LOCK}] \label{param:ShadowLock} This entry
  specifies what lock file should be used for access to the
  \File{ShadowLog} file.  It must be a separate file from the
  \File{ShadowLog}, since the \File{ShadowLog} may be rotated and you
  want to be able to synchronize access across log file rotations.
  This macro is defined relative to the \Macro{LOCK} macro described
  above.  If, for some strange reason, you decide to change this
  setting, be sure to change the \Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry that
  \Condor{preen} uses as well.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ShadowDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the shadow) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Shadow-PVM-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{shadow.pvm} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control the \Condor{shadow.pvm}, the special shadow
that supports PVM jobs inside Condor.  See
section~\ref{sec:Install-PVM-Condor} ``Installing PVM Support in
Condor'' for details.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{PVMD}] \label{param:PvmD}  This macro holds the full path
  to the special \Condor{pvmd}, the Condor PVM Daemon.  This daemon is
  installed in the regular Condor release directory by default, so the
  macro is usually defined in terms of \MacroU{SBIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{PVMGS}] \label{param:PvmGS} This macro holds the full
  path to the special \Condor{pvmgs}, the Condor PVM Group Server
  Daemon, which is needed to support PVM groups.  This daemon is
  installed in the regular Condor release directory by default, so the
  macro is usually defined in terms of \MacroU{SBIN}.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ShadowDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the shadow) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Starter-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{starter} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This setting effects the \Condor{starter}.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{JOB\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}] \label{param:JobReniceIncrement}
  When the starter spawns a Condor job, it can do so with a
  \Term{nice-level}.  This is a mechanism in UNIX where you can assign
  your own processes a lower priority so that they don't interfere
  with interactive use of the machine.  If you have machines with lots
  of real memory and swap space so the only scarce resource is CPU
  time, you could use this setting in conjunction with a policy that
  always allowed Condor to start jobs on your machines so that Condor
  jobs would always run, but interactive response on your machines
  would never suffer.  You probably wouldn't even notice Condor was
  running jobs.  See section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on
  ``Configuring The Startd Policy'' for full details on setting up a
  policy for starting and stopping jobs on a given machine.  The entry
  can be any integer between 1 and 19.  It is commented out by
  default.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_LOCAL\_LOGGING}]
  \label{param:StarterLocalLogging} This macro determines whether the
  starter should do local logging to its own log file, or send debug
  information back to the \Condor{shadow} where it will end up in the
  ShadowLog.  It defaults to ``True''

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_DEBUG}] \label{param:StarterDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the starter) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Submit-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{submit} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you want \Condor{submit} to automatically append an expression to
the Requirements expression or Rank expression of jobs at your site
use the following entries:

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA}] \label{param:AppendReqVanilla}
  Expression to append to vanilla job requirements.
  
\item[\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD}] \label{param:AppendReqStandard}
  Expression to append to standard job requirements.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_STANDARD}] \label{param:AppendRankStandard}
  Expression to append to vanilla job rank.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_VANILLA}] \label{param:AppendRankVanilla}
  Expression to append to standard job rank.

\end{description}

\textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE:} The \Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_STANDARD} and 
\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_VANILLA} macros were called
``\Macro{APPEND\_PREF\_STANDARD}'' and
``\Macro{APPEND\_PREF\_VANILLA}'' in previous versions of Condor.

In addition, you can provide default Rank expressions if your users
don't specify their own:

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_RANK\_VANILLA}] \label{param:DefaultRankVanilla}
  Default Rank for vanilla jobs.  

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_RANK\_STANDARD}] \label{param:DefaultRankStandard}
  Default Rank for standard jobs.

\end{description}

Both of these macros default to the jobs preferring machines where
there is more main memory than the image size of the job, expressed
as:

\begin{verbatim}
        ((Memory*1024) > Imagesize)
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Preen-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{preen} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control \Condor{preen}.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{PREEN\_ADMIN}] \label{param:PreenAdmin}  This entry
  determines what email address \Condor{preen} will send email to (if
  it's configured to send email at all... see the entry for
  \Macro{PREEN} above).  Defaults to \MacroU{CONDOR\_ADMIN}.

\item[\Macro{VALID\_SPOOL\_FILES}] \label{param:ValidSpoolFiles}  This
  entry contains a (comma or space separated) list of files that
  \Condor{preen} considers valid files to find in the \Macro{SPOOL}
  directory.  Defaults to all the files that are valid.  If you change
  the \Macro{HISTORY} setting above, you'll want to change this
  setting as well.
  
\item[\Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES}] \label{param:ValidLogFiles} This
  entry contains a (comma or space separated) list of files that
  \Condor{preen} considers valid files to find in the \Macro{LOG}
  directory.  Defaults to all the files that are valid.  If you change
  the names of any of the log files above, you'll want to change this
  setting as well.  In addition the defaults for the
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE} are listed here, so if you change
  those, you'll need to change this entry, too.

\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Collector-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{collector} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control the \Condor{collector}.

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{CLASSAD\_LIFETIME}] \label{param:ClassadLifetime} This
  macro determines how long a ClassAd can remain in the collector
  before it is discarded as stale information.  The ClassAds sent to
  the collector might also have an attribute that says how long the
  lifetime should be for that specific ad.  If that attribute is
  present the collector will either use it or the
  \Macro{CLASSAD\_LIFETIME}, whichever is greater.  The macro is
  defined in terms of seconds, and defaults to 900 (15 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{MASTER\_CHECK\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterCheckInterval}  This setting defines often the
  collector should check for machines that have ClassAds from some
  daemons, but not from the \Condor{master} (\Term{orphaned daemons})
  and send email about it.  Defined in seconds, defaults to 10800 (3
  hours)
  
\item[\Macro{CLIENT\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:ClientTimeout} Network
  timeout when talking to daemons that are sending an update.  Defined
  in seconds, defaults to 30.
  
\item[\Macro{QUERY\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:QueryTimeout} Network
  timeout when talking to anyone doing a query. Defined in seconds,
  defaults to 60.
  
\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS}] \label{param:CondorDevelopers}
  Condor will send email once per week to this address with the output
  of the \Condor{status} command, which simply lists how many machines
  are in the pool and how many are running jobs.  Use the default
  value of ``condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu''. This default will send the
  weekly status message to the Condor Team at University of
  Wisconsin-Madison, the developers of Condor.  The Condor Team uses
  these weekly status messages in order to have some idea as to how
  many Condor pools exist in the world.  We would really appreciate
  getting the reports as this is one way we can convince funding
  agencies that Condor is being used in the ``real world''.  If you do
  not wish this information to be sent to the Condor Team, you could
  enter ``NONE'' which disables this feature, or put in some other
  address that you want the weekly status report sent to.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_NAME}] \label{param:CollectorName}
  The parameter is used to specify a short description of your pool.
  It should be about 20 characters long.  For example, the name of the
  UW-Madison Computer Science Condor Pool is ``UW-Madison CS''.  

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS\_COLLECTOR}]
  \label{param:CondorDevelopersCollector} By default, every pool sends
  periodic updates to a central \Condor{collector} at UW-Madison with
  basic information about the status of your pool.  This includes only
  the number of total machines, the number of jobs submitted, the
  number of machines running jobs, the hostname of your central
  manager, and the \Macro{COLLECTOR\_NAME} specified above.  These
  updates help us see how Condor is being used around the world.  By
  default, they will be sent to condor.cs.wisc.edu.  If you don't want
  these updates to be sent from your pool, set this entry to
  ``NONE''. 

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_DEBUG}] \label{param:CollectorDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the collector) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Negotiator-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{negotiator} Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These settings control the \Condor{negotiator}.

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:NegotiatorInterval}
  How often should the negotiator start a negotiation cycle?  Defined
  in seconds, defaults to 300 (5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:NegotiatorTimeout}
  What timeout should the negotiator use on it's network connections
  to the schedds and startds?  Defined in seconds, defaults to 30.
  
\item[\Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE}] \label{param:PriorityHalfLife} This
  entry defines the half-life of the user priorities.  See
  section~\ref{sec:user-priority-explained}
  on User Priorities for more details.  Defined in seconds, defaults
  to 86400 (1 day).
  
\item[\Expr{PREEMPTION\_HOLD}] \label{param:PreemptionHold} If the
  \Expr{PREEMPTION\_HOLD} expression evaluates to true, the
  \Condor{negotiator} won't preempt the job running on a given machine
  even if a user with a higher priority has jobs they want to run.
  This helps prevents thrashing.  The default is to wait 2 hours
  before preempting any job.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_DEBUG}] \label{param:NegotiatorDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the negotiator) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.
