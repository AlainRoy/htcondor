\index{Condor!configuration}
\index{configuration}

This section describes how to configure all parts of the Condor
system.  General information about the configuration
files and their syntax is followed by a description of
settings that affect all
Condor daemons and tools.
The 
settings that control the policy under which Condor will start,
suspend, resume, vacate or kill jobs
are described in 
section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on Startd Policy Configuration. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Intro-to-Config-Files}
Introduction to Configuration Files}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Condor configuration files are used to customize how Condor
operates at a given site.  The basic configuration as shipped with
Condor works well for most sites, with few exceptions.

See section~\ref{sec:install} on
page~\pageref{sec:install}
for details on where
Condor's configuration files are found.

Each Condor program will, as part of its initialization process,
configure itself by calling a library routine which parses the
various configuration files that might be used including pool-wide,
platform-specific, machine-specific, and root-owned configuration files.


The order in which attributes are defined is important, since later
definitions will override existing definitions.
This is particularly important if configuration files are broken up
using the \Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} setting described in
sections~\ref{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries}
and~\ref{sec:Multiple-Platforms} below.

The result of configuration is a list of key/value pairs.
Each key is a configuration variable name,
and each value is a string literal
that may utilize macro substitution (as defined below).
Note that the string literal value portion of a pair is not an expression,
and therefore it is not evaluated.
Those configuration variables that express the policy for
starting and stopping of jobs appear as expressions in the
configuration file.
However, these expressions (for configuration) are string literals.
Other portions of Condor use these strings as expressions,
parsing them in order to do evaluation.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:Config-File-Macros}
Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{macro!in configuration file}
\index{configuration file!macro definitions}

Macro definitions are of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
        <macro_name> = <macro_definition>
\end{verbatim}

\Note There must be white space between the macro name, the
``='' sign, and the macro definition.

Macro invocations are of the form: 
\begin{verbatim}
        $(macro_name)
\end{verbatim}

Macro definitions may contain references to other macros, even ones
that are not yet defined (as long as they are eventually defined in
the configuration files).
All macro expansion is done after all configuration files have been parsed
(with the exception of macros that reference themselves, described
below). 

\begin{verbatim}
        A = xxx
        C = $(A) 
\end{verbatim}
is a legal set of macro definitions, and the resulting value of 
\MacroNI{C} is
\Expr{xxx}.
Note that
\MacroNI{C} is actually bound to 
\MacroUNI{A}, not its value.

As a further example,
\begin{verbatim}
        A = xxx
        C = $(A)
        A = yyy
\end{verbatim}
is also a legal set of macro definitions, and the resulting value of
\MacroNI{C} is \Expr{yyy}.  

A macro may be incrementally defined by invoking itself in its
definition.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
	A = xxx
	B = $(A)
	A = $(A)yyy
	A = $(A)zzz
\end{verbatim}
is a legal set of macro definitions, and the resulting value of 
\MacroNI{A}
is \Expr{xxxyyyzzz}.
Note that invocations of a macro in
its own definition are immediately
expanded.
\MacroUNI{A} is immediately expanded in line 3 of the example.
If it were not, then the definition would be impossible to
evaluate.

Recursively defined macros such as
\begin{verbatim}
    A = $(B)
    B = $(A)
\end{verbatim}
are not allowed.
They create definitions that Condor refuses to parse. 

\Note Macros should not be incrementally defined in the
\Macro{LOCAL\_ROOT\_CONFIG\_FILE} for security reasons.

% commented out in 2005, as it is too old, and is now confusing
%\Note Condor used to distinguish between ``macros'' and ``expressions''
%in its config files.
%Beginning with Condor version 6.1.13, this distinction has been
%removed.
%For backward compatibility, you can still use ``:'' instead of ``=''
%in your config files, and these attributes will just be treated as
%macros.

All entries in a configuration file must have an operator,
which will be an equals sign (``='').
%or a colon character (``:'').
Identifiers must be alphanumerics combined with the underscore character.
As a special case,
a line without an operator that begins with a left square bracket
will be ignored.
The following two-line example treats the first line as a comment,
and correctly handles the second line.
\begin{verbatim}
[Condor Settings]
my_classad = [ foo=bar ]
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Config-File-Special}
Special Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration file!\$ENV definition}
\index{\$ENV!in configuration file}
References to the Condor process's environment are allowed in the
configuration files.
Environment references are of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
        $ENV(environment_variable_name)
\end{verbatim}
For example, 
\begin{verbatim}
        A = $ENV(HOME)
\end{verbatim}
binds \MacroNI{A} to the value of the HOME environment variable.
Environment references are not currently used in standard Condor
configurations.
However, they can sometimes be useful in custom configurations.

\index{RANDOM\_CHOICE() macro!use in configuration file}
\index{\$RANDOM\_CHOICE()!in configuration}
\index{configuration macro!RANDOM\_CHOICE() macro}
This same syntax is used to allow a random choice of a parameter
within a configuration file.
These references are of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
        $RANDOM_CHOICE(list of parameters)
\end{verbatim}
This allows a random choice within the parameter list to be made
at configuration time.  Of the list of parameters, one is
chosen when encountered during configuration.  For example,
if one of the integers 0-8 (inclusive) should be randomly
chosen, the macro usage is
\begin{verbatim}
        $RANDOM_CHOICE(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
\end{verbatim}
  See section~\ref{sec:randomchoiceusage} on
  page~\pageref{sec:randomchoiceusage}
  for an actual use of this specialized macro.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Other-Syntax}
Comments and Line Continuations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A Condor configuration file may contain comments and
line continuations.
A comment is any line beginning with a ``\#'' character.
A continuation is any entry that continues across multiples lines.
Line continuation is accomplished by placing the ``$\backslash$''
character at the end of any line to be continued onto another.
Valid examples of line continuation are
\begin{verbatim}
        START = (KeyboardIdle > 15 * $(MINUTE)) && \
                ((LoadAvg - CondorLoadAvg) <= 0.3)
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
        ADMIN_MACHINES = condor.cs.wisc.edu, raven.cs.wisc.edu, \
                        stork.cs.wisc.edu, ostrich.cs.wisc.edu, \
                        bigbird.cs.wisc.edu
        HOSTALLOW_ADMIN = $(ADMIN_MACHINES)
\end{verbatim}

Note that a line continuation character may currently be used within
a comment, so the following example does \emph{not} set the
configuration variable \MacroNI{FOO}:
\begin{verbatim}
	# This comment includes the following line, so FOO is NOT set \
        FOO = BAR
\end{verbatim}
It is a poor idea to use this functionality, as it is likely to
stop working in future Condor releases.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sec:Pre-Defined-Macros}
Pre-Defined Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!pre-defined macros}
Condor provides pre-defined macros that help configure Condor.
Pre-defined macros are listed as \MacroUNI{macro\_name}.

This first set are entries whose values are determined at
run time and cannot be overwritten.  These are inserted automatically by
the library routine which parses the configuration files.
\index{configuration file!pre-defined macros}
\begin{description}
  
\item[\MacroU{FULL\_HOSTNAME}] \label{param:FullHostname}
  The
  fully qualified hostname of the local machine (hostname plus domain
  name).
  
\item[\MacroU{HOSTNAME}] \label{param:Hostname}
  The hostname of the local machine (no domain name).
  
\item[\MacroU{IP\_ADDRESS}] \label{param:IpAddress}
  The ASCII string version of the local machine's IP address.

\item[\MacroU{TILDE}] \label{param:Tilde}
  The full path to the
  home directory of the Unix user condor, if such a user exists on the
  local machine.

\label{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}
\index{configuration file!subsystem names}
\item[\MacroU{SUBSYSTEM}] \label{param:Subsystem}
  The subsystem
  name of the daemon or tool that is evaluating the macro.
  This is a unique string which identifies a given daemon within the
  Condor system.  The possible subsystem names are:

\index{subsystem names}
\index{macro!subsystem names}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item STARTD
  \item SCHEDD
  \item MASTER
  \item COLLECTOR
  \item NEGOTIATOR
  \item KBDD 
  \item SHADOW
  \item STARTER
  \item CKPT\_SERVER
  \item SUBMIT
  \item GRIDMANAGER
  \item TOOL
  \label{list:subsystem names}
  \end{itemize}

\end{description}

This second set of macros are entries whose default values are
determined automatically at runtime but which can be overwritten.  
\index{configuration file!macros}
\begin{description}

\item[\MacroU{ARCH}] \label{param:Arch}
  Defines the string
  used to identify the architecture of the local machine to Condor.
  The \Condor{startd} will advertise itself with this attribute so
  that users can submit binaries compiled for a given platform and
  force them to run on the correct machines.  \Condor{submit} will
  append a requirement to the job ClassAd that it must
  run on the same \MacroNI{ARCH} and \MacroNI{OPSYS} of the machine where
  it was submitted, unless the user specifies \MacroNI{ARCH} and/or
  \MacroNI{OPSYS} explicitly in their submit file.  See the
  the \Condor{submit} manual page
  on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} for details.

\item[\MacroU{OPSYS}] \label{param:OpSys}
  Defines the string used to identify the operating system
  of the local machine to Condor.
  If it is not defined in the configuration file, Condor will
  automatically insert the operating system of this machine as
  determined by \Prog{uname}.

\item[\MacroU{UNAME\_ARCH}] \label{param:UnameArch}
  The architecture as reported by \Prog{uname}(2)'s \Code{machine} field.
  Always the same as \MacroNI{ARCH} on Windows.

\item[\MacroU{UNAME\_OPSYS}] \label{param:UnameOpsys}
  The operating system as reported by \Prog{uname}(2)'s \Code{sysname} field.
  Always the same as \MacroNI{OPSYS} on Windows.

\item[\MacroU{PID}] \label{param:Pid}
  The process ID for the daemon or tool.

\item[\MacroU{PPID}] \label{param:Ppid}
  The process ID of the parent process for the daemon or tool.

\item[\MacroU{USERNAME}] \label{param:Username}
  The user name of the UID of the daemon or tool.
  It is useful for setting \MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_LOG},
  as that needs to be done on a per-user basis.
  For daemons started as root, but running under another UID
  (typically the user condor), this will be the other UID.

\item[\MacroU{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}]
  \label{param:FilesystemDomain}
  Defaults to the fully
  qualified hostname of the machine it is evaluated on.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries}, Shared
  File System Configuration File Entries for the full description of
  its use and under what conditions you would want to change it.

\item[\MacroU{UID\_DOMAIN}]
  \label{param:UIDDomain}
  Defaults to the fully
  qualified hostname of the machine it is evaluated on.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries} on ``Shared
  File System Configuration File Entries'' for the full description of
  its use and under what conditions you would want to change it.

\end{description}

Since \MacroUNI{ARCH} and \MacroUNI{OPSYS} will automatically be set to the
correct values, we recommend that you do not overwrite them.
Only do so if you know what you are doing.
  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Condor-wide-Config-File-Entries}
Condor-wide Configuration File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!Condor-wide configuration variables}

This section describes settings which affect all parts of the Condor
system. 
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_HOST}] \label{param:CondorHost} This macro may be
  used to define the \MacroUNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} and is used to define the
  \MacroUNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST} macro.  Normally the \Condor{collector}
  and \Condor{negotiator} would run on the same machine.  If for some
  reason they were not run on the same machine,
  \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_HOST} would not be needed.  Some
  of the host-based security macros use \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_HOST} by
  default.  See section~\ref{sec:Host-Security}, on Setting up
  IP/host-based security in Condor for details.
  
\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_HOST}] \label{param:CollectorHost} The
  hostname of the machine where the \Condor{collector} is running for
  your pool.  Normally, it is defined relative to
  the \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_HOST}
  macro.  There is no default value for this macro;
  \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST} must be defined for the pool to work
  properly.

  In addition to defining the hostname, this setting can optionally be
  used to specify the network port of the \Condor{collector}.
  The port is separated from the hostname by a colon ('\verb@:@').
  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
  COLLECTOR_HOST = $(CONDOR_HOST):1234
\end{verbatim}
  If no port is specified, the default port of 9618 is used.
  Using the default port is recommended for most sites.
  It is only changed if there is a conflict with another
  service listening on the same network port.
  For more information about specifying a non-standard port for the
  \Condor{collector} daemon,
  see section~\ref{sec:Ports-NonStandard} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Ports-NonStandard}.


\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST}] \label{param:NegotiatorHost} 
  This configuration variable is no longer used.
  The port where the \Condor{negotiator} is listening is normally
  dynamically allocated since version 6.7.4.

  For pools running 6.7.3 and older versions: The
  host name of the machine where the \Condor{negotiator} is running for
  the pool.
  Normally, it is defined relative to the \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_HOST}
  macro.  There is no default value for this macro;
  \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} must be defined for the pool to work
  properly.
  This variable may also be used to optionally define a network port for
  the \Condor{negotatior} daemon, as explained for the
  \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST} variable.

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST}] \label{param:CondorViewHost} The
  hostname of the machine where the CondorView server is running.
  This service is optional, and requires additional configuration if
  you want to enable it.  There is no default value for
  \MacroNI{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST}.  If \MacroNI{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST} is not
  defined, no CondorView server is used.
  See section~\ref{sec:Contrib-CondorView-Install} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Contrib-CondorView-Install} for more details.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_HOST}] \label{param:ScheddHost} The
  hostname of the machine where the \Condor{schedd} is running for
  your pool.  This is the host that queues submitted jobs.  Note that,
  in most condor installations, there is a \Condor{schedd} running on
  each host from which jobs are submitted.  The default value of
  \Macro{SCHEDD\_HOST} is the current host.  For most pools, this
  macro is not defined.

\item[\Macro{RELEASE\_DIR}] \label{param:ReleaseDir} The full path to
  the Condor release directory, which holds the \File{bin},
  \File{etc}, \File{lib}, and \File{sbin} directories.  Other macros
  are defined relative to this one.  There is no default value for
  \Macro{RELEASE\_DIR}.

\item[\Macro{BIN}] \label{param:Bin} This directory points to the
  Condor directory where user-level programs are installed.  It is
  usually defined relative to the \MacroUNI{RELEASE\_DIR} macro.
  There is no default value for \Macro{BIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{LIB}] \label{param:Lib} This directory points to the
  Condor directory where libraries used to link jobs for Condor's
  standard universe are stored.  The \Condor{compile} program uses
  this macro to find these libraries, so it must be defined for
  \Condor{compile} to function.  \MacroUNI{LIB} is usually defined
  relative to the \MacroUNI{RELEASE\_DIR} macro, and has no default
  value.

\item[\Macro{LIBEXEC}] \label{param:LibExec} This directory points
  to the Condor directory where support commands that Condor
  needs will be placed.
  Do not add this directory to a user or systemwide path.

\item[\Macro{INCLUDE}] \label{param:Include} This directory points
  to the Condor directory where header files reside.
  \MacroUNI{INCLUDE} would usually be defined relative to
  the \MacroUNI{RELEASE\_DIR} configuration macro.
  There is no default value, but
  if defined, it can make inclusion of necessary header files
  for compilation of programs (such as those programs
  that use \File{libcondorapi.a})
  easier through the use of \Condor{config\_val}.

\item[\Macro{SBIN}] \label{param:Sbin} This directory points to the
  Condor directory where Condor's system binaries (such as the
  binaries for the Condor daemons) and administrative tools are
  installed.  Whatever directory \MacroU{SBIN} points to ought
  to be in the \Env{PATH} of users acting as Condor
  administrators.  \Macro{SBIN} has no default value.

\item[\Macro{LOCAL\_DIR}] \label{param:LocalDir} The location of the
  local Condor directory on each machine in your pool.  One common
  option is to use the condor user's home directory which may be
  specified with \MacroUNI{TILDE}.  There is no default value for
  \Macro{LOCAL\_DIR}.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(tilde)
\end{verbatim}
  
  On machines with a shared file system, where either the
  \MacroUNI{TILDE} directory or another directory you want to use is
  shared among all machines in your pool, you might use the
  \MacroUNI{HOSTNAME} macro and have a directory with many
  subdirectories, one for each machine in your pool, each named by
  host names.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(tilde)/hosts/$(hostname)      
\end{verbatim}
  or:
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_DIR = $(release_dir)/hosts/$(hostname)
\end{verbatim}
  
\item[\Macro{LOG}] \label{param:Log} Used to specify the
  directory where each Condor daemon writes its log files.  The names
  of the log files themselves are defined with other macros, which use
  the \MacroUNI{LOG} macro by default.  The log directory also acts as
  the current working directory of the Condor daemons as the run, so
  if one of them should produce a core file for any reason, it would
  be placed in the directory defined by this macro.  \MacroNI{LOG} is
  required to be defined.  Normally, \MacroUNI{LOG} is defined in
  terms of \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{SPOOL}] \label{param:Spool} The spool directory is where
  certain files used by the \Condor{schedd} are stored, such as the
  job queue file and the initial executables of any jobs that have
  been submitted.  In addition, for systems not using a checkpoint
  server, all the checkpoint files from jobs that have been submitted
  from a given machine will be store in that machine's spool
  directory.  Therefore, you will want to ensure that the spool
  directory is located on a partition with enough disk space.  If a
  given machine is only set up to execute Condor jobs and not submit
  them, it would not need a spool directory (or this macro defined).
  There is no default value for \Macro{SPOOL}, and the \Condor{schedd}
  will not function without it \Macro{SPOOL} defined.  Normally,
  \MacroUNI{SPOOL} is defined in terms of \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{EXECUTE}] \label{param:Execute} This directory acts as
  the current working directory of any Condor job that is executing on
  the local machine.  If a given machine is only set up to only submit
  jobs and not execute them, it would not need an execute directory
  (or this macro defined).  There is no default value for
  \MacroNI{EXECUTE}, and the \Condor{startd} will not function if
  \MacroNI{EXECUTE} is not defined.  Normally, \MacroUNI{EXECUTE} is
  defined in terms of \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_DIR}.
  
\item[\Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE}] \label{param:LocalConfigFile} The
  location of the local, machine-specific configuration
  file for each machine
  in your pool.  The two most common options would be putting this
  file in the \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_DIR}, or putting all
  local configuration files for your pool in a shared directory, each one
  named by hostname.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(LOCAL_DIR)/condor_config.local
\end{verbatim}
  or,
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = $(release_dir)/etc/$(hostname).local
\end{verbatim}
  or, not using your release directory
\begin{verbatim}
        LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = /full/path/to/configs/$(hostname).local
\end{verbatim}
  
  Beginning with Condor version 6.0.1, the
  \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} is treated as a list of files, not a
  single file.  You can use either a comma or space separated list of
  files as its value.  This allows you to specify multiple files as
  the local configuration file and each one will be processed in the
  order given (with parameters set in later files overriding values
  from previous files).  This allows you to use one global
  configuration file for multiple platforms in your pool, define a
  platform-specific configuration file for each platform, and use a
  local configuration file for each machine. 
  If the list is changed in one of the included files, the new list
  replaces the old list, but any files that have already been processed
  remain processed and are removed from the new list if they are present
  to prevent cycles.
  If \Macro{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} is not defined, no local configuration
  files are processed.  For more information on this, see
  section~\ref{sec:Multiple-Platforms} about Configuring Condor for
  Multiple Platforms on page~\pageref{sec:Multiple-Platforms}.

\item[\Macro{REQUIRE\_LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE}] \label{param:RequireLocalConfigFile}
  Beginning in Condor 6.5.5, it is permissible for the files listed as the
  local config file to be missing. This is most useful for sites that have 
  large numbers of machines in the pool, and a local config file that uses
  the hostname builtin macro - instead of having an empty file for every host
  in the pool, some files can simply be omitted. The default setting is True,
  and Condor will exit with an error if the file listed as the local config 
  file cannot be read, unless \MacroNI{REQUIRE\_LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE} is set 
  to False 

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_IDS}] \label{param:CondorIds}
  The User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) pair that the Condor daemons
  should run as, if the daemons are spawned as root.
  This value can also be specified in the \Env{CONDOR\_IDS}
  environment variable.
  If the Condor daemons are not started as root, then neither this
  \MacroNI{CONDOR\_IDS} configuration macro nor the \Env{CONDOR\_IDS}
  environment variable are used.
  The value is given by two integers, separated by a period.  For
  example, \verb@CONDOR_IDS = 1234.1234@.
  If this pair is not specified in either the configuration file or in the
  environment, and the Condor daemons are spawned as root,
  then Condor will
  search for a \verb@condor@ user on the system, and run as that user's
  UID and GID.
  See section~\ref{sec:uids} on UIDs in Condor for more details.

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN}] \label{param:CondorAdmin} The email
  address that Condor will send mail to if something goes wrong in
  your pool.  For example, if a daemon crashes, the \Condor{master}
  can send an \Term{obituary} to this address with the last few lines
  of that daemon's log file and a brief message that describes what
  signal or exit status that daemon exited with.  There is no default
  value for \Macro{CONDOR\_ADMIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_SUPPORT\_EMAIL}] \label{param:CondorSupportEmail}
  The email address to be included at the bottom of all email Condor
  sends out under the label ``Email address of the local Condor
  administrator:''.  
  This is the address where Condor users at your site should send
  their questions about Condor and get technical support.
  If this setting is not defined, Condor will use the address
  specified in \MacroNI{CONDOR\_ADMIN} (described above).

\item[\Macro{MAIL}] \label{param:Mail} The full path to a mail
  sending program that uses \Opt{-s} to specify a subject for the
  message.  On all platforms, the default shipped with Condor should
  work.  Only if you installed things in a non-standard location on
  your system would you need to change this setting.  There is no
  default value for \MacroNI{MAIL}, and the \Condor{schedd} will not
  function unless \MacroNI{MAIL} is defined.

\item[\Macro{RESERVED\_SWAP}] \label{param:ReservedSwap} Determines
  how much swap space you want to reserve for your own machine.
  Condor will not start up more \Condor{shadow} processes if the
  amount of free swap space on your machine falls below this level.
  \MacroNI{RESERVED\_SWAP} is specified in megabytes.  The default value
  of \MacroNI{RESERVED\_SWAP} is 5 megabytes.

\item[\Macro{RESERVED\_DISK}] \label{param:ReservedDisk} Determines
  how much disk space you want to reserve for your own machine.  When
  Condor is reporting the amount of free disk space in a given
  partition on your machine, it will always subtract this amount.  An
  example is the \Condor{startd}, which advertises the amount of free
  space in the \MacroUNI{EXECUTE} directory.  The default value of
  \Macro{RESERVED\_DISK} is zero.
  
\item[\Macro{LOCK}] \label{param:Lock} Condor needs to create
  lock files to synchronize access to various log files.  Because of
  problems with network file systems and file locking over
  the years, we \emph{highly} recommend that you put these lock
  files on a local partition on each machine.  If you do not have your
  \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_DIR} on a local partition, be sure to change this
  entry.

  Whatever user or group Condor is running as needs to have
  write access to this directory.  If you are not running as root, this
  is whatever user you started up the \Condor{master} as.  If you are
  running as root, and there is a condor account, it is most
  likely condor.
  Otherwise, it is whatever you set in the \Env{CONDOR\_IDS}
  \index{environment variables!CONDOR\_IDS@\texttt{CONDOR\_IDS}}
  \index{CONDOR\_IDS@\texttt{CONDOR\_IDS}!environment variable}
  environment variable, or whatever you define in the
  \MacroNI{CONDOR\_IDS} setting in the Condor config files.
  See section~\ref{sec:uids} on UIDs in Condor for details.

  If no value for \MacroNI{LOCK} is provided, the value of \MacroNI{LOG}
  is used.


\item[\Macro{HISTORY}] \label{param:History} Defines the
  location of the Condor history file, which stores information about
  all Condor jobs that have completed on a given machine.  This macro
  is used by both the \Condor{schedd} which appends the information
  and \Condor{history}, the user-level program used to view
  the history file.
  This configuration macro is given the default value of
  \File{\$(SPOOL)/history} in the default configuration.
  If not defined,
  no history file is kept.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: YES 
% Default definition in config file: $(SPOOL)/history
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: no history file is kept.

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME}] \label{param:DefaultDomainName}
  If you do not use a fully qualified name in file \File{/etc/hosts}
  (or NIS, etc.) for either your official hostname or as an
  alias, Condor would not normally be able to use fully qualified names
  in places that it wants to.  You can set this macro to the
  domain to be appended to your hostname, if changing your host
  information is not a good option.  This macro must be set in the
  global configuration file (not the \MacroUNI{LOCAL\_CONFIG\_FILE}.
  The reason for this is that the special \MacroUNI{FULL\_HOSTNAME}
  macro is used by the configuration file code in Condor needs
  to know the full hostname.  So, for \MacroUNI{DEFAULT\_DOMAIN\_NAME} to
  take effect, Condor must already have read in its value.  However,
  Condor must set the \MacroUNI{FULL\_HOSTNAME} special macro since you
  might use that to define where your local configuration file is.  After
  reading the global configuration file, Condor figures out the right values
  for \MacroUNI{HOSTNAME} and \MacroUNI{FULL\_HOSTNAME} and inserts them
  into its configuration table.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus value
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: autodiscovered domain, if any, is used.

\item[\Macro{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES}] \label{param:BindAllInterfaces}
  For systems with multiple network interfaces, if this configuration
  setting is not defined, Condor binds all network sockets to first
  interface found, or the IP address specified with
  \MacroNI{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} (described below).
  Starting with version 6.7.13, \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} can be
  set to \verb@TRUE@ to cause Condor to bind to all interfaces on the
  machine.
  However, currently Condor is still only able to advertise a single
  IP address, even if it is listening on multiple interfaces.
  More information about using this setting can be found in
  section~\ref{sec:Using-BindAllInterfaces} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Using-BindAllInterfaces}. 

\item[\Macro{NETWORK\_INTERFACE}] \label{param:NetworkInterface}
  For systems with multiple network interfaces, if this configuration
  setting is not defined, Condor binds all network sockets to first
  interface found.
  To bind to a specific network interface other than the
  first one, this \MacroNI{NETWORK\_INTERFACE} should be set to 
  the IP address to use.
  When \MacroNI{BIND\_ALL\_INTERFACES} is set to \verb@TRUE@, this
  setting simply controls what IP address a given Condor host will
  advertise.
  More information about configuring Condor on machines with multiple
  network interfaces can be found in
  section~\ref{sec:Multiple-Interfaces} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Multiple-Interfaces}.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: NO
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: N/A
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: Condor binds to first interface found

\item[\Macro{CM\_IP\_ADDR}] \label{param:CMIPAddr}
  If neither \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST} nor 
  \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_IP\_ADDR} macros are defined, then this
  macro will be used to determine the IP address of the central
  manager (collector daemon).
  This macro is defined by an IP address.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: NO
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: N/A
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: Condor performs above algorithm

\item[\Macro{HIGHPORT}] \label{param:HighPort}
  Specifies an upper limit of given port numbers for Condor to use,
  such that Condor is restricted to a range of port numbers.
  If this macro is not explicitly specified, then Condor will
  not restrict the port numbers that it uses. Condor will use
  system-assigned port numbers.
  For this macro to work, both \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} and
  \MacroNI{LOWPORT} (given below) must be defined.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: Condor uses any ports available,
% regardless of the LOWPORT setting

\item[\Macro{LOWPORT}] \label{param:LowPort}
  Specifies a lower limit of given port numbers for Condor to use,
  such that Condor is restricted to a range of port numbers.
  If this macro is not explicitly specified, then Condor will
  not restrict the port numbers that it uses. Condor will use
  system-assigned port numbers.
  For this macro to work, both \MacroNI{HIGHPORT} (given above) and
  \MacroNI{LOWPORT} must be defined.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: Condor uses any ports available,
% regardless of the HIGHPORT setting

\item[\Macro{EMAIL\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:EmailDomain}
  By default, if a user does not specify \AdAttr{notify\_user} in the
  submit description file, any email Condor sends about that job will
  go to "username@UID\_DOMAIN".
  If your machines all share a common UID domain (so that you would
  set \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} to be the same across all machines in your
  pool), but email to user@UID\_DOMAIN is not the right place for
  Condor to send email for your site, you can define the default
  domain to use for email.
  A common example would be to set \MacroNI{EMAIL\_DOMAIN} to the fully
  qualified hostname of each machine in your pool, so users submitting
  jobs from a specific machine would get email sent to
  user@machine.your.domain, instead of user@your.domain.  
  You would do this by setting \MacroNI{EMAIL\_DOMAIN} to
  \MacroUNI{FULL\_HOSTNAME}. 
  In general, you should leave this setting commented out unless two
  things are true: 1) \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} is set to your domain, not
  \MacroUNI{FULL\_HOSTNAME}, and 2) email to user@UID\_DOMAIN will not 
  work. 
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: 
%	Condor will try to use the notify_user attribute email in the job ad.
%	If that is not present, then it will use the UID_DOMAIN embedded in
%	the job ad.
%	If that is not present, then it will use the UID_DOMAIN found in the
%	config file.
%	If that is not present, then I suspect there is a bug and the code will
%	segfault!!! (This needs fixing...)
 
\item[\Macro{CREATE\_CORE\_FILES}] \label{param:CreateCoreFiles}
  Defines whether or not Condor daemons are to
  create a core file in the \Macro{LOG} directory
  if something really bad happens.  It is
  used to set
  the resource limit for the size of a core file.  If not defined,
  it leaves in place whatever limit was in effect
  when the Condor daemons (normally the \Condor{master}) were started.
  This allows Condor to inherit the default system core file generation
  behavior at startup.  For Unix operating systems, this behavior can
  be inherited from the parent shell, or specified in a shell script
  that starts Condor.
  If this parameter is set and TRUE, the limit is increased to
  the maximum.  If it is set to FALSE, the limit is set at 0
  (which means that no core files are created).  Core files
  greatly help the Condor developers debug any problems you might be
  having.  By using the parameter, you do not have to worry about
  tracking down where in your boot scripts you need to set the core
  limit before starting Condor. You set the parameter
  to whatever behavior you want Condor to enforce.  This parameter
  defaults to undefined to allow the initial operating system default
  value to take precedence, 
  and is commented out in the default configuration file. 
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: shell's default corelimit size applies

\item[\Macro{Q\_QUERY\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:QQueryTimeout}
  Defines the timeout (in seconds) that \Condor{q} uses when trying to
  connect to the \Condor{schedd}.  Defaults to 20 seconds.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: NO
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: N/A
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: defaults to 20 seconds.

\item[\Macro{UPDATE\_COLLECTOR\_WITH\_TCP}]
  \label{param:UpdateCollectorWithTcp}
  If your site needs to use TCP connections to send ClassAd updates to
  your collector (which it almost certainly does NOT), set to TRUE
  to enable this feature.
  Please read section~\ref{sec:tcp-collector-update} on ``Using TCP to
  Send Collector Updates'' on page~\pageref{sec:tcp-collector-update}
  for more details and a discussion of when this
  functionality is needed. 
  At this time, this setting only affects the main \Condor{collector}
  for the site, not any sites that a \Condor{schedd} might flock to. 
  If enabled, also define
  \Macro{COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE}] at the central manager, so
  that the collector will accept TCP connections for updates, and will
  keep them open for reuse.
  Defaults to FALSE.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: disable the feature of TCP updates to
% collectors
% WARNING: The code also looks for UPDATE_COLLECTORS_WITH_TCP, which
% means the SAME THING as UPDATE_COLLECTOR_WITH_TCP

\item[\Macro{TCP\_UPDATE\_COLLECTORS}]
  \label{param:TcpUpdateCollectors}
  The list of collectors which will be updated with TCP instead of UDP.
  Please read section~\ref{sec:tcp-collector-update} on ``Using TCP to
  Send Collector Updates'' on page~\pageref{sec:tcp-collector-update}
  for more details and a discussion of when a site needs this
  functionality. 
  If not defined, no collectors use TCP instead of UDP.
% PKK
% Described in default config file: NO
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: N/A
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: no collectors are updated with TCP
% WARNING: Look in Version 6.5.2 version history for more information about
% this particular entry.

\item[\Macro{PASSWD\_CACHE\_REFRESH}]
  \label{param:PasswdCacheRefresh}
  Condor can cause NIS servers to become overwhelmed by queries for uid
  and group information in large pools. In order to avoid this problem,
  Condor caches UID and group information internally. This setting allows
  pool administrators to specify (in seconds) how long Condor should wait
  until refreshes a cache entry. The default is set to 300 seconds, or
  5 minutes. This means that if a pool administrator updates the user
  or group database (for example, \File{/etc/passwd} or \File{/etc/group}),
  it can take up
  to 5 minutes before Condor will have the updated information. This
  caching feature can be disabled by setting the refresh interval to
  0. In addition, the cache can also be flushed explicitly by running
  the command
\begin{verbatim}
     condor_reconfig -full
\end{verbatim}
  This configuration variable has no effect on Windows.
% PKK

\subsection{\label{sec:Daemon-Logging-Config-File-Entries}
Daemon Logging Config File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!daemon logging configuration variables}
These entries control how and where the Condor daemons write their log
files.  Each of the entries in this section represents multiple
macros. There is one for each subsystem (listed
in section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}).
The macro name for each substitutes \MacroNI{SUBSYS} with the name
of the subsystem corresponding to the daemon.
\begin{description}
 
\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_LOG}] \label{param:SubsysLog} The name of
  the log file for a given subsystem.  For example,
  \MacroUNI{STARTD\_LOG} gives the location of the log file for
  \Condor{startd}.

  The actual names of the files
  are also used in the \MacroUNI{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry used by
  \Condor{preen}.  A change to one of the
  file names with this setting requires a change to the
  \MacroUNI{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry as well, or \Condor{preen} will
  delete your newly named log files.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_SUBSYS\_LOG}] \label{param:MaxSubsysLog} Controls
  the maximum length in bytes to which a
  log will be allowed to grow.  Each log file will grow to the
  specified length, then be saved to a file with the suffix
  \File{.old}.  The \File{.old}
  files are overwritten each time the log is saved, thus the maximum
  space devoted to logging for any one program will be twice the
  maximum length of its log file.  A value of 0 specifies that the
  file may grow without bounds.  The default is 1 Mbyte.

\item[\Macro{TRUNC\_SUBSYS\_LOG\_ON\_OPEN}]
  \label{param:TruncSubsysLogOnOpen}  If this macro is defined and set
  to TRUE, the affected log will be truncated and started from an
  empty file with each invocation of the program.  Otherwise, new
  invocations of the program will append to the previous log
  file.  By default this setting is FALSE for all daemons. 

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_LOCK}] \label{param:SubsysLock} This macro
  specifies the lock file used to synchronize append operations to the
  log file for this subsystem.  It must be a separate file from the
  \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_LOG} file, since the \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_LOG} file may be
  rotated and you want to be able to synchronize access across log
  file rotations.  A lock file is only required for log files which
  are accessed by more than one process.  Currently, this includes
  only the \MacroNI{SHADOW} subsystem.  This macro is defined relative
  to the \MacroUNI{LOCK} macro.  If, for some strange
  reason, you decide to change this setting, be sure to change the
  \MacroUNI{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry that \Condor{preen} uses as well.

\item[\Macro{FILE\_LOCK\_VIA\_MUTEX}] \label{param:FileLockViaMutex} 
  This macro setting only works on Win32 -- it is ignored on Unix.  If set
  to be \Expr{True}, then log locking is implemented via a kernel mutex
  instead of via file locking.  On Win32, mutex access is FIFO, while
  obtaining a file lock is non-deterministic.  Thus setting to \Expr{True}
  fixes problems on Win32 where processes (usually shadows) could starve
  waiting for a lock on a log file.  Defaults to \Expr{True} on Win32, and is
  always \Expr{False} on Unix.

\item[\Macro{ENABLE\_USERLOG\_LOCKING}] \label{param:EnableUserlogLocking}
  When \Expr{True} (the default value),
  a user's job log (as specified in a submit description file)
  will be locked before being written to.
  If \Expr{False}, Condor will not lock the file before writing.

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}] \label{param:SubsysDebug} All of the
  Condor daemons can produce different levels of output depending on
  how much information is desired.  The various levels of
  verbosity for a given daemon are determined by this macro.  All
  daemons have the default level \Dflag{ALWAYS}, and log messages for
  that level will be printed to the daemon's log, regardless of this
  macro's setting.  Settings are a comma- or space-separated list
  of the following values:

\begin{description}
\label{list:debug-level-description}

\item[\Dflag{ALL}] \label{dflag:all}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_ALL@\texttt{D\_ALL}}
  This flag turns on \emph{all} debugging output by enabling all of the debug
  levels at once.  There is no need to list any other debug levels in addition
  to \Dflag{ALL}; doing so would be redundant.  Be warned: this will
  generate
  about a \emph{HUGE} amount of output.
  To obtain a higher
  level of output than the default, consider using \Dflag{FULLDEBUG} before
  using this option.

\item[\Dflag{FULLDEBUG}] \label{dflag:fulldebug}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_FULLDEBUG@\texttt{D\_FULLDEBUG}}
  This level
  provides verbose output of a general nature into the log files.  
  Frequent log messages for very specific debugging
  purposes would be excluded. In those cases, the messages would
  be viewed by having that another flag and \Dflag{FULLDEBUG} both
  listed in the configuration file.

\item[\Dflag{DAEMONCORE}] \label{dflag:daemoncore} 
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_DAEMONCORE@\texttt{D\_DAEMONCORE}}
  Provides log
  file entries specific to DaemonCore, such as
  timers the daemons have set and the commands that are registered.
  If both \Dflag{FULLDEBUG} and \Dflag{DAEMONCORE} are set,
  expect \emph{very} verbose output.

\item[\Dflag{PRIV}] \label{dflag:priv}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_PRIV@\texttt{D\_PRIV}}
  This flag provides log
  messages about the \Term{privilege state} switching that the daemons
  do.  See section~\ref{sec:uids} on UIDs in Condor for details.

\item[\Dflag{COMMAND}] \label{dflag:command}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_COMMAND@\texttt{D\_COMMAND}}
  With this flag set, any
  daemon that uses DaemonCore will print out a log message
  whenever a command comes in.  The name and integer of the command,
  whether the command was sent via UDP or TCP, and where
  the command was sent from are all logged.  
  Because the messages about the command used by \Condor{kbdd} to
  communicate with the \Condor{startd} whenever there is activity on
  the X server, and the command used for keep-alives are both only
  printed with \Dflag{FULLDEBUG} enabled, it is best if this setting
  is used for all daemons.

\item[\Dflag{LOAD}] \label{dflag:load}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_LOAD@\texttt{D\_LOAD}}
The \Condor{startd} keeps track
  of the load average on the machine where it is running.  Both the
  general system load average, and the load average being generated by
  Condor's activity there are determined.
  With this flag set, the \Condor{startd}
  will log a message with the current state of both of these
  load averages whenever it computes them.  This flag only affects the
  \Condor{startd}.

\item[\Dflag{KEYBOARD}] \label{dflag:keyboard} 
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_KEYBOARD@\texttt{D\_KEYBOARD}}
  With this flag set, the \Condor{startd} will print out a log message
  with the current values for remote and local keyboard idle time.
  This flag affects only the \Condor{startd}.

\item[\Dflag{JOB}] \label{dflag:job}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_JOB@\texttt{D\_JOB}}
  When this flag is set, the
  \Condor{startd} will send to its log file the contents of any
  job ClassAd that the \Condor{schedd} sends to claim the
  \Condor{startd} for its use.  This flag affects only the
  \Condor{startd}.
  
\item[\Dflag{MACHINE}] \label{dflag:machine}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_MACHINE@\texttt{D\_MACHINE}}
  When this flag is set,
  the \Condor{startd} will send to its log file the contents of
  its resource ClassAd when the \Condor{schedd} tries to claim the
  \Condor{startd} for its use.  This flag affects only the
  \Condor{startd}.

\item[\Dflag{SYSCALLS}] \label{dflag:syscalls}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_SYSCALLS@\texttt{D\_SYSCALLS}}
  This flag is used to
  make the \Condor{shadow} log remote syscall requests and return
  values.  This can help track down problems a user is having with a
  particular job by providing the system calls the job is
  performing. If any are failing, the reason for the
  failure is given.  The \Condor{schedd} also uses this flag for the server
  portion of the queue management code.  With \Dflag{SYSCALLS}
  defined in \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_DEBUG} there will be verbose logging of all
  queue management operations the \Condor{schedd} performs.  

\item[\Dflag{MATCH}] \label{dflag:match}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_MATCH@\texttt{D\_MATCH}}
  When this flag is
  set, the \Condor{negotiator} logs a message for every match.

\item[\Dflag{NETWORK}] \label{dflag:network}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_NETWORK@\texttt{D\_NETWORK}}
  When this flag is set,
  all Condor daemons will log a message on every TCP accept, connect,
  and close, and on every UDP send and receive.  This flag is not
  yet fully supported in the \Condor{shadow}.

\item[\Dflag{HOSTNAME}] \label{dflag:hostname}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_HOSTNAME@\texttt{D\_HOSTNAME}}
  When this flag is set, the Condor daemons and/or tools will print
  verbose messages explaining how they resolve host names, domain
  names, and IP addresses.
  This is useful for sites that are having trouble getting Condor to
  work because of problems with DNS, NIS or other host name resolving
  systems in use.

\item[\Dflag{CKPT}] \label{dflag:ckpt}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_CKPT@\texttt{D\_CKPT}}
  When this flag is set,
  the Condor process checkpoint support code, which is linked into a STANDARD 
  universe user job, will output some low-level details about the checkpoint
  procedure into the \MacroUNI{SHADOW\_LOG}.

\item[\Dflag{SECURITY}] \label{dflag:security}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_SECURITY@\texttt{D\_SECURITY}}
  This flag will enable debug messages pertaining to the setup of 
  secure network communication, 
  including messages for the negotiation of a socket 
  authentication mechanism, the management of a session key cache.
  and messages about the authentication process itself.  See
  section~\ref{sec:Config-Security} for more information about
  secure communication configuration.

\item[\Dflag{PROCFAMILY}] \label{dflag:procfamily}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_PROCFAMILY@\texttt{D\_PROCFAMILY}}
  Condor often times needs to manage an entire family of processes, (that
  is, a 
  process and all descendants of that process).  This debug flag will 
  turn on debugging output for the management of families of processes.

\item[\Dflag{ACCOUNTANT}] \label{dflag:accountant}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_ACCOUNTANT@\texttt{D\_ACCOUNTANT}}
  When this flag is set,
  the \Condor{negotiator} will output debug messages relating to the computation
  of user priorities (see section~\ref{sec:UserPrio}).

\item[\Dflag{PROTOCOL}] \label{dflag:protocol}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_PROTOCOL@\texttt{D\_PROTOCOL}}
  Enable debug messages relating to the protocol for Condor's matchmaking and
  resource claiming framework.
	
\item[\Dflag{PID}] \label{dflag:pid}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_PID@\texttt{D\_PID}}
  This flag is different from the other flags, because it is
  used to change the formatting of all log messages that are printed,
  as opposed to specifying what kinds of messages should be printed.
  If \Dflag{PID} is set, Condor will always print out the process
  identifier (PID) of the process writing each line to the log file.
  This is especially helpful for Condor daemons that can fork
  multiple helper-processes (such as the \Condor{schedd} or
  \Condor{collector}) so the log file will clearly show which thread
  of execution is generating each log message.
	
\item[\Dflag{FDS}] \label{dflag:fds}
  \index{SUBSYS\_DEBUG macro levels@\texttt{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} macro levels!D\_FDS@\texttt{D\_FDS}}
  This flag is different from the other flags, because it is
  used to change the formatting of all log messages that are printed,
  as opposed to specifying what kinds of messages should be printed.
  If \Dflag{FDS} is set, Condor will always print out the file descriptor
  that the open of the log file was allocated by the operating system.
  This can be helpful in debugging Condor's use of system file
  descriptors as it will generally track the number of file descriptors
  that Condor has open.

	
\end{description}

\item[\Macro{ALL\_DEBUG}] \label{param:AllDebug} Used to make all subsystems
  share a debug flag. Set the parameter \MacroNI{ALL\_DEBUG}
  instead of changing all of the individual parameters.  For example,
  to turn on all debugging in all subsystems, set
  \verb$ALL_DEBUG = D_ALL$.

\item[\Macro{TOOL\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ToolDebug} Uses the same
  values (debugging levels) as \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} to
  describe the amount of debugging information sent to \File{stderr} 
  for Condor tools.

\item[\Macro{SUBMIT\_DEBUG}] \label{param:SubmitDebug} Uses the same
  values (debugging levels) as \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} to
  describe the amount of debugging information sent to \File{stderr} 
  for \Condor{submit}.

\end{description}

Log files may optionally be specified per debug level as follows:
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_LEVEL\_LOG}] \label{param:SubsysLevelLog} This is
  the name of a log file for messages at a specific debug level for a
  specific subsystem.  If the debug level is included in
  \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}, then all messages of this debug level will be
  written both to the \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_LOG} file and the
  \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_LEVEL\_LOG} file.  For example,
  \MacroUNI{SHADOW\_SYSCALLS\_LOG} specifies a log file for all remote
  system call debug messages.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_SUBSYS\_LEVEL\_LOG}] \label{param:MaxSubsysLevelLog}
  Similar to \Macro{MAX\_SUBSYS\_LOG}.

\item[\Macro{TRUNC\_SUBSYS\_LEVEL\_LOG\_ON\_OPEN}]
  \label{param:TruncSubsysLevelLogOnOpen} Similar to
  \Macro{TRUNC\_SUBSYS\_LOG\_ON\_OPEN}.

Please read section~\ref{sec:DaemonCore} for details
on DaemonCore.  There are certain configuration file settings that
DaemonCore uses which affect all Condor daemons (except the checkpoint
server, shadow, and starter, none of which use DaemonCore yet).
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{HOSTALLOW\Dots}] \label{param:HostAllow} All
  macros that begin with either \Macro{HOSTALLOW} or
  \Macro{HOSTDENY} are settings for Condor's host-based security.

  configuration values that can be changed using the \Condor{config\_val} 
  command.
  Section~\ref{sec:Host-Security} on Setting up
  IP/Host-Based Security in Condor for details on these
  macros and how to configure them.  
  In particular, section~\ref{sec:Host-Security}
  on page~\pageref{sec:Host-Security} contains details specific to
  these macros.

\item[\Macro{SHUTDOWN\_GRACEFUL\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:ShutdownGracefulTimeout} Determines how long
  Condor will allow daemons try their graceful shutdown methods
  before they do a hard shutdown.  It is defined in terms of seconds.
  The default is 1800 (30 minutes).

% This macro existed for 6.2.x, but does not exist any more.
%\item[\Macro{AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS}]\label{param:AuthenticationMethods}
%  There are many instances when the Condor system needs to authenticate
%  the identity of the user.  For instance, when a job is submitted with
%  \Condor{submit}, Condor needs to authenticate the user so that the job
%  goes into the queue and runs with the proper credentials.  The
%  \MacroNI{AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS} parameter is a list of
%  permitted authentication methods.  The list is ordered by
%  preference.  The actual authentication method used is the first method
%  in this list that both the server and client are able to perform.
%  Possible values are:
%  \begin{itemize}
%	\item NTSSPI Use NT's standard LAN-MANAGER challenge-response protocol.
%	\Note This is the default method used on Windows NT.
%	\item FS Use the filesystem to authenticate the user.  
%		The server requests the client to create a specified temporary
%		file, then the server verifies the ownership of that file. \Note
%		This is the default method used on Unix systems.
%	\item FS\_REMOTE Use a shared filesystem to authenticate the user.
%		This is useful for submitting jobs to a remote schedd.
%		Similar to FS authentication, except the temporary file to be
%		created by the user must be on a shared filesystem (AFS, NFS, etc.)
%		If the client's submit description file does not define the 
%		command \Opt{rendezvousdir}, the \Opt{initialdir} value is used 
%		as the default directory in which to create the temporary file.
%		\Note Normal AFS issues apply here: Condor must be able to write
%		to the directory used.
% commented out by Karen for 6.4.3
%       \item GSS Use Generic Security Services, which is implemented in Condor 
%		with X.509 certificates. See section~\ref{sec:X509-Authentication}.
%		These X.509 certificates are compatible with the Globus system from
%		Argonne National Labs.
%	\item CLAIMTOBE The server should simply trust the client.  
%		\Note You had better trust all users who have access to your Condor
%		pool if you enable CLAIMTOBE authentication.
%  \end{itemize}

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE}]
  \label{param:SubsysAddressFile}
  \index{}
  \index{NEGOTIATOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE macro@\texttt{NEGOTIATOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE} macro}
  \index{configuration macro!\texttt{NEGOTIATOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE}}
  \index{COLLECTOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE macro@\texttt{COLLECTOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE} macro}
  \index{configuration macro!\texttt{COLLECTOR\_ADDRESS\_FILE}}
  A complete path to a file that is to contain an
  IP address and port number for a daemon. 
  Every Condor daemon that uses
  DaemonCore has a command port where commands are sent.
  The IP/port of the daemon is put in that daemon's ClassAd,
  so that other machines in the pool can query the
  \Condor{collector} (which listens on a well-known port)
  to find the address of a given daemon on a given machine.
  When tools and daemons are all executing on the same
  single machine, communications do not require a query of the
  \Condor{collector} daemon.
  Instead, they look in a file on the local disk
  to find the IP/port.
  This macro causes daemons to write the
  IP/port of their command socket to a specified file.
  In this way,
  local tools will continue to operate,
  even if the machine running the \Condor{collector} crashes.
  Using this file will also generate
  slightly less network traffic in the pool,
  since tools including \Condor{q} and
  \Condor{rm} do not need to send any messages over the network to
  locate the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
  This macro is not necessary for the \Condor{collector} 
  daemon, since it's command socket is at a well-known port.  
  
\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_ATTRS} or \label{param:SubsysExprs}
\Macro{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}] \label{param:SubsysAttrs}
  Allows any DaemonCore daemon to advertise arbitrary
  expressions from the configuration file in its ClassAd.  Give the
  comma-separated list of entries from the configuration file you want in the
  given daemon's ClassAd.
  Frequently used to add attributes to machines so that the
  machines can discriminate between other machines in a job's 
  \Opt{rank}
    and \Opt{requirements}.

  These settings are synonyms; you can use them interchangeably or use both.
  For example, \MacroNI{STARTD\_ATTRS} and
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_EXPRS} are interchangeable.
  
  \Note The \Condor{kbdd} does not send
  ClassAds now, so this entry does not affect it.  The
  \Condor{startd}, \Condor{schedd}, \Condor{master}, and
  \Condor{collector} do send ClassAds, so those would be valid
  subsystems to set this entry for.
  
  \MacroNI{SUBMIT\_EXPRS} not part of the \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_EXPRS}, it is
  documented in section~\ref{sec:Submit-Config-File-Entries}

  The \Condor{startd} \MacroU{STARTD\_ATTRS} defaults to
  ``JobUniverse''.

  Because of the different syntax of the configuration
  file and ClassAds, a little extra work is required to get a
  given entry into a ClassAd.  In particular, ClassAds require quote
  marks (") around strings.  Numeric values and boolean expressions
  can go in directly.  
  For example, if the startd is to advertise a string macro, a numeric
  macro, and a boolean expression, do something similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
        STRING = This is a string 
        NUMBER = 666
        BOOL1 = True
        BOOL2 = CurrentTime >= $(NUMBER) || $(BOOL1)
        MY_STRING = "$(STRING)"
        STARTD_ATTRS = MY_STRING, NUMBER, BOOL1, BOOL2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\label{sec:Shared-Filesystem-Config-File-Entries}
Shared File System Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{configuration!shared file system configuration variables}

These macros control how Condor interacts with various shared and
network file systems.  If you are using AFS as your shared filesystem,
be sure to read section~\ref{sec:Condor-AFS} on Using Condor with
AFS.
For information on submitting jobs under shared file systems,
see
section~\ref{sec:shared-fs}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{UID\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:UidDomain}
The \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} macro
is used to decide under which user to run your jobs.
If the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
on the submitting machine is different than
the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
on the machine that runs your job, then Condor will run
the job as the user called ``nobody''.
For example, if the submit machine has
the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
``flippy.cs.wisc.edu'' and the machine where the job will execute
has the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
``cs.wisc.edu'', the job will run as user nobody, because
the two \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}s are not the same.
If the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
is the same on both the submit and execute machines,
then Condor will run the job as the user that submitted the job.

A further check attempts to assure that the submitting
machine can not lie about its \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}.
Condor compares the 
submit machine's claimed \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
to its fully qualified name.
If the two do not end the same, then the submit machine
is presumed to be lying about its \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}.
In this case, Condor will run the job as user nobody.
For example, a job submission to the Condor pool at the UW Madison
from ``flippy.example.com'', claiming a \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
of ``cs.wisc.edu'',
will run the job as the user nobody.

Because of this verification,
\MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN} must be a real domain name.
At the Computer Sciences department
at the UW Madison, we set the \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
to be ``cs.wisc.edu'' to
indicate that whenever someone submits from a department machine, we
will run the job as the user who submits it.

Also see \Macro{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN}
below for information about one more check
that Condor performs before running a job as a given user.

A few details:

You could set \MacroU{UID\_DOMAIN}
to ``*''. This will match all domains,
but it is a gaping security hole. It is not recommended.

You can also leave \MacroU{UID\_DOMAIN} undefined. This will
force Condor to always run jobs as user nobody.
Running standard universe jobs as user nobody enhances
your security and should cause no problems, because the jobs use remote
I/O to access all of their files.
However, if vanilla jobs are run as
user nobody, then files that need to be accessed by the job will need
to be marked as world readable/writable so the user nobody can access
them.

When Condor sends e-mail about a job, Condor sends the e-mail to
%% This is the wrong LaTeX  macro to use, but we don't have a correct one.
\File{user@UID\_DOMAIN}.
If \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}
is undefined, the e-mail is sent to \File{user@submitmachinename}.


\item[\Macro{TRUST\_UID\_DOMAIN}]
  \label{param:TrustUidDomain}
  As an added security precaution when Condor is about to spawn a job,
  it ensures that the \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} (defined above) of a given
  submit machine is a substring of that machine's fully-qualified
  host name.
  However, at some sites, there may be multiple UID spaces that do
  not clearly correspond to Internet domain names.
  In these cases, administrators may wish to use names to describe the
  UID domains which are not substrings of the hostnames of the
  machines.
  For this to work, Condor must not do this regular security check.
  If the \MacroNI{TRUST\_UID\_DOMAIN} setting is defined to TRUE,
  Condor will not perform this test, and will trust whatever
  \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN} is presented by the submit machine when trying
  to spawn a job, instead of making sure the submit machine's hostname
  matches the \MacroNI{UID\_DOMAIN}.
  When not defined, the default is FALSE,
  since it is more secure to perform this test. 
% PKK
% Described in default config file: YES
% Defined in the default config file: NO
% Default definition in config file: bogus
% Result if not defined or RHS is empty: this entry is considered False

\item[\Macro{SOFT\_UID\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:SoftUidDomain}
When Condor is about to run a job as a particular user (instead of the
user nobody, see \Macro{UID\_DOMAIN} above for when this happens),
it verifies that the UID given for the user is in the
password file and actually matches the given user name.
However, some
installations may not have every user in every machine's password
file, so this check will fail and the execution attempt will be
aborted. If you prefer that Condor not do
this check, because users are not in every password file, set
this attribute to \Expr{True}. Condor will then run the job under the
user's UID anyway.


\item[\Macro{VMx\_USER}] \label{param:VMxUser}
The name of a user for Condor to use instead of
user nobody,
as part of a solution that plugs a security hole whereby
a lurker process can prey on a subsequent job run as user name nobody. 
\MacroNI{x} is an integer associated with virtual machines.
On Windows, \MacroNI{VMx\_USER}
will only work if the credential of the specified
user is stored on the execute machine using \Condor{store\_cred}.
See Section~\ref{sec:RunAsNobody} for more information.

\item[\Macro{EXECUTE\_LOGIN\_IS\_DEDICATED}]
\label{param:ExecuteLoginIsDedicated}
When set to True,
forces Condor to use the users given by the \MacroNI{VMx\_USER}
configuration variable.
Defaults to False.

\item[\Macro{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:FilesystemDomain}
The \MacroNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}
macro is an arbitrary string that is used to decide if
two machines (a submitting machine and an execute machine) share a
file system.
Although the macro name contains the word ``DOMAIN'',
the macro is not required to be a domain name. 
It often is a domain name.

% NO LONGER TRUE
% Vanilla Unix jobs currently require a shared file system in order to
% share any data files or see the output of the program.
% Condor decides if there is a shared filesystem by comparing the values
% of 
% \MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}
% of both the submitting and execute machines.
% If the values are the same,
% Condor assume there is a shared file system.
% Condor implements the check
% by extending the Requirements for your job.
% You can see these requirements by using the \oArg{-v} argument
% to \Condor{submit}.

Note that this implementation is not ideal: machines may share some
file systems but not others. Condor currently has no way to express
this automatically. You can express the need to use a
particular file system by adding additional attributes to your machines
and submit files, similar to the example given in 
Frequently Asked Questions, 
section~\ref{sec:FAQ} on
how to run jobs only on machines that have 
certain software packages.

Note that if you do not set 
\MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN}, Condor defaults
to setting the macro's value to be the fully qualified hostname
of the local machine.
Since each machine will have a different
\MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN},
they will not be considered to have shared file systems.

  
% no longer used, and gone from the sample config file as of 5/30/03.
%\item[\Macro{HAS\_AFS}] \label{param:HasAfs} Set this macro to TRUE if
%  all the machines you plan on adding in your pool can all access a
%  common set of AFS fileservers.  Otherwise, set it to FALSE.
      
\item[\Macro{RESERVE\_AFS\_CACHE}] \label{param:ReserveAfsCache} If
  your machine is running AFS and the AFS cache lives on the same
  partition as the other Condor directories, and you want Condor to
  reserve the space that your AFS cache is configured to use, set this
  macro to TRUE.  It defaults to FALSE.
  
\item[\Macro{USE\_NFS}] \label{param:UseNfs} This macro influences
  how Condor jobs running in the standard universe access their
  files.  Condor will redirect the file I/O requests
  of standard universe jobs to be executed on the machine which
  submitted the job.  Because of this, as a Condor job migrates around
  the network, the file system always appears to be identical to the
  file system where the job was submitted.  However, consider the case
  where a user's data files are sitting on an NFS server. The machine
  running the user's program will send all I/O over the network to the
  machine which submitted the job, which in turn sends all the I/O
  over the network a second time back to the NFS file server. Thus,
  all of the program's I/O is being sent over the network twice.
          
  If this macro to TRUE, then Condor will attempt to
  read/write files without redirecting I/O back to the submitting
  machine if both the submitting machine and the machine running the job
  are both accessing the same NFS servers (\emph{if} they are both in the
  same \MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} and in the same \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN},
  as described above).  The result is I/O performed by Condor standard
  universe jobs is only sent over the network once.  
  While sending all file operations over the network twice might sound
  really bad, unless you are operating over networks where bandwidth
  as at a very high premium, practical experience reveals that this
  scheme offers very little real performance gain.  There are also
  some (fairly rare) situations where this scheme can break down.
  
  Setting \MacroUNI{USE\_NFS} to FALSE is always safe.  It may result
  in slightly more network traffic, but Condor jobs are most often heavy
  on CPU and light on I/O.  It also ensures that a remote
  standard universe Condor job will always use Condor's remote system
  calls mechanism to reroute I/O and therefore see the exact same
  file system that the user sees on the machine where she/he submitted
  the job.
  
  Some gritty details for folks who want to know: If the you set
  \MacroUNI{USE\_NFS} to TRUE, and the \MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} of
  both the submitting machine and the remote machine about to execute
  the job match, and the \MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} claimed by the
  submit machine is indeed found to be a subset of what an inverse
  lookup to a DNS (domain name server) reports as the fully qualified
  domain name for the submit machine's IP address (this security
  measure safeguards against the submit machine from lying),
  \emph{then} the job will access files using a local system call,
  without redirecting them to the submitting machine (with
  NFS).  Otherwise, the system call will get routed back to the
  submitting machine using Condor's remote system call mechanism.
  \Note When submitting a vanilla job, \Condor{submit} will, by default,
  append requirements to the Job ClassAd that specify the machine to run
  the job must be in the same \MacroUNI{FILESYSTEM\_DOMAIN} and the same
  \MacroUNI{UID\_DOMAIN}.

\item[\Macro{IGNORE\_NFS\_LOCK\_ERRORS}] \label{param:IgnoreNFSLockErrors}
  When set to TRUE, all errors related to file locking errors from
  NFS are ignored.
  Defaults to FALSE, not ignoring errors.
  
\item[\Macro{USE\_AFS}] \label{param:UseAfs} If your machines have AFS,
  this
  macro determines whether Condor will use remote system calls for
  standard universe jobs to send I/O requests to the submit machine,
  or if it should use local file access on the execute machine (which
  will then use AFS to get to the submitter's files).  Read the
  setting above on \MacroUNI{USE\_NFS} for a discussion of why you might
  want to use AFS access instead of remote system calls.
  
  One important difference between \MacroUNI{USE\_NFS} and
  \MacroUNI{USE\_AFS} is the AFS cache.  With \MacroUNI{USE\_AFS} set to
  TRUE, the remote Condor job executing on some machine will start
  modifying the AFS cache, possibly evicting the machine owner's
  files from the cache to make room for its own.  Generally speaking,
  since we try to minimize the impact of having a Condor job run on a
  given machine, we do not recommend using this setting.

  While sending all file operations over the network twice might sound
  really bad, unless you are operating over networks where bandwidth
  as at a very high premium, practical experience reveals that this
  scheme offers very little real performance gain.  There are also
  some (fairly rare) situations where this scheme can break down.
  
  Setting \MacroUNI{USE\_AFS} to FALSE is always safe.  It may result
  in slightly more network traffic, but Condor jobs are usually heavy
  on CPU and light on I/O.  FALSE ensures that a remote
  standard universe Condor job will always see the exact same
  file system that the user on sees on the machine where he/she
  submitted the job.  Plus, it will ensure that the machine where the
  job executes does not have its AFS cache modified as a result of
  the Condor job being there.  
  
  However, things may be different at your site, which is why the
  setting is there.

\subsection{\label{Checkpoint-Server-Config-File-Entries}
Checkpoint Server Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!checkpoint server configuration variables}
These macros control whether or not Condor uses a checkpoint server.
If you are using a checkpoint server, this section
describes the settings that the checkpoint server itself needs
defined.  A checkpoint server is installed
separately. It is not included in the main Condor binary
distribution or installation procedure.  See
section~\ref{sec:Ckpt-Server} on Installing a Checkpoint Server
for details on installing and running a checkpoint server for your
pool.

\Note If you are setting up a machine to join the UW-Madison CS
Department Condor pool, you \emph{should} configure the machine to
use a checkpoint server, and use ``condor-ckpt.cs.wisc.edu'' as the
checkpoint server host (see below).

\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST}] \label{param:CkptServerHost} The
  hostname of a checkpoint server.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_CHOOSES\_CKPT\_SERVER}]
  \label{param:StarterChoosesCkptServer} If this parameter is TRUE 
  or undefined on
  the submit machine, the checkpoint server specified by
  \MacroUNI{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST} on the execute machine is used.  If it is
  FALSE on the submit machine, the checkpoint server
  specified by \MacroUNI{CKPT\_SERVER\_HOST} on the submit machine is
  used.
  
\item[\Macro{CKPT\_SERVER\_DIR}] \label{param:CkptServerDir} The
  checkpoint server needs this macro defined to the full path of the
  directory the server should use to store checkpoint files.
  Depending on the size of your pool and the size of the jobs your
  users are submitting, this directory (and its subdirectories) might
  need to store many Mbytes of data.

\item[\Macro{USE\_CKPT\_SERVER}] \label{param:UseCkptServer} A boolean
  which determines if you want a given submit machine to use a
  checkpoint server if one is available.  If a
  checkpoint server isn't available or \MacroNI{USE\_CKPT\_SERVER} is set to
  False, checkpoints will be written to the local \MacroUNI{SPOOL} directory on
  the submission machine.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_DISCARDED\_RUN\_TIME}]
  \label{param:MaxDiscardedRunTime} If the shadow is unable to read a
  checkpoint file from the checkpoint server, it keeps trying only if
  the job has accumulated more than this many seconds of CPU usage.
  Otherwise, the job is started from scratch.  Defaults to 3600 (1
  hour). This setting is only used if \MacroUNI{USE\_CKPT\_SERVER} is
  TRUE.

\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:Master-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{master} Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!condor\_master configuration variables}
These macros control the \Condor{master}.
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}] \label{param:DaemonList} This macro
  determines what daemons the \Condor{master} will start and keep its
  watchful eyes on.  The list is a comma or space separated list of
  subsystem names (listed in
  section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}).  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
        DAEMON_LIST = MASTER, STARTD, SCHEDD
\end{verbatim}

  \Note This configuration variable cannot be changed 
  by using \Condor{reconfig} or 
  by sending a SIGHUP.
  To change this configuration variable, restart the
  \Condor{master} daemon
  by using \Condor{restart}.
  Only then will the change take effect.

  \Note On your central manager, your \MacroUNI{DAEMON\_LIST}
  will be different from your regular pool, since it will include
  entries for the \Condor{collector} and \Condor{negotiator}.  
  
  \Note On machines running Digital Unix or IRIX, your
  \MacroUNI{DAEMON\_LIST} will also include KBDD, for the
  \Condor{kbdd}, which is a special daemon that runs to monitor
  keyboard and mouse activity on the console.  It is only with this
  special daemon that we can acquire this information on those
  platforms. 

\item[\Macro{DC\_DAEMON\_LIST}] \label{param:DCDaemonList} This macro
  lists the daemons in \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST} which use the Condor
  DaemonCore library.  The \Condor{master} must differentiate between
  daemons that use DaemonCore and those that don't so it uses the
  appropriate inter-process communication mechanisms.  This list
  currently includes all Condor daemons except the checkpoint server
  by default.
  
\item[\Macro{SUBSYS}] \label{param:SUBSYS} Once you have defined which
  subsystems you want the \Condor{master} to start, you must provide
  it with the full path to each of these binaries.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
        MASTER          = $(SBIN)/condor_master
        STARTD          = $(SBIN)/condor_startd
        SCHEDD          = $(SBIN)/condor_schedd
\end{verbatim}
  These are most often defined relative to the \MacroUNI{SBIN} macro.

\item[\Macro{DAEMONNAME\_ENVIRONMENT}] \label{param:DaemonNameEnvironment}
  For each subsystem defined in \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST}, you may specify
  changes to the environment that daemon is started with by setting
  \MacroNI{DAEMONNAME\_ENVIRONMENT}, where \MacroNI{DAEMONNAME} is the name of
  a daemon listed in \MacroNI{DAEMON\_LIST}. It should be set to a semicolon
  delimited list of name=value pairs. For example, if you wish to redefine the
  \Env{TMP} and \Env{CONDOR\_CONFIG} environment variables seen by the
  \Condor{schedd}, you could place the following in the config file:
\begin{verbatim}
        SCHEDD_ENVIRONMENT = TMP=/new/value;CONDOR_CONFIG=/special/config
\end{verbatim}
  When the \Condor{schedd} was started by the \Condor{master}, it would
  see the specified values of \Env{TMP} and \Env{CONDOR\_CONFIG}.

\item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_ARGS}] \label{param:SubsysArgs} This macro
  allows the specification of additional command line arguments for any
  process spawned by the \Condor{master}.
  List the desired arguments, as typing the
  command line into the configuration file.  
  Set the arguments for a specific daemon with this macro,
  and the macro will affect only that daemon. Define
  one of these for each daemon the \Condor{master} is controlling.
  For example, set \MacroUNI{STARTD\_ARGS} to specify any extra
  command line arguments to the \Condor{startd}.

\item[\Macro{PREEN}] \label{param:Preen} In addition to the daemons
  defined in \MacroUNI{DAEMON\_LIST}, the \Condor{master} also starts up
  a special process, \Condor{preen} to clean out junk files that have
  been left laying around by Condor.  This macro determines where the
  \Condor{master} finds the \Condor{preen} binary.
  Comment out this macro, and \Condor{preen} will not run.

\item[\Macro{PREEN\_ARGS}] \label{param:PreenArgs}
  Controls how \Condor{preen} behaves by allowing the specification
  of command-line arguments.
  This macro works as \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_ARGS} does.
  The difference is that you must specify this macro for
  \Condor{preen} if you want it to do anything.
  \Condor{preen} takes action only
  because of command line arguments.
  \Opt{-m} means you want e-mail about files \Condor{preen} finds that it
  thinks it should remove.
  \Opt{-r} means you want \Condor{preen} to actually remove these files.

\item[\Macro{PREEN\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:PreenInterval} This macro
  determines how often \Condor{preen} should be started.  It is
  defined in terms of seconds and defaults to 86400 (once a day).

\item[\Macro{PUBLISH\_OBITUARIES}] \label{param:PublishObituaries}
  When a daemon crashes, the \Condor{master} can send e-mail to the
  address specified by \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_ADMIN} with an obituary letting
  the administrator know that the daemon died, the cause of
  death (which signal or exit status it exited with), and
  (optionally) the last few entries from that daemon's log file.  If
  you want obituaries, set this macro to TRUE.

\item[\Macro{OBITUARY\_LOG\_LENGTH}] \label{param:ObituaryLogLength}
  This macro controls how many lines
  of the log file are part of obituaries.

\item[\Macro{START\_MASTER}] \label{param:StartMaster} If this setting
  is defined and set to FALSE when the \Condor{master} starts up, the first
  thing it will do is exit.  This appears strange, but perhaps you
  do not want Condor to run on certain machines in your pool, yet
  the boot scripts for your entire pool are handled by a centralized
  system that starts up the \Condor{master} automatically.  This is
  an entry you would most likely find in a local configuration file,
  not a global configuration file.

\item[\Macro{START\_DAEMONS}] \label{param:StartDaemons} This macro
  is similar to the \MacroUNI{START\_MASTER} macro described above.
  However, the \Condor{master} does not exit; it does not start any
  of the daemons listed in the \MacroUNI{DAEMON\_LIST}.
  The daemons may be started at a later time with a \Condor{on}
  command.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterUpdateInterval} This macro determines how often
  the \Condor{master} sends a ClassAd update to the
  \Condor{collector}.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 300
  (every 5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{MASTER\_CHECK\_NEW\_EXEC\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterCheckNewExecInterval} This
  macro controls how often the \Condor{master} checks the timestamps
  of the running daemons.  If any daemons have been modified, the
  master restarts them.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 300
  (every 5 minutes).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_NEW\_BINARY\_DELAY}]
  \label{param:MasterNewBinaryDelay} Once the \Condor{master} has
  discovered a new binary, this macro controls how long it waits
  before attempting to execute the new binary.  This delay exists
  because the \Condor{master} might notice a new binary while it
  is in the process of being copied,
  in which case trying to execute it yields
  unpredictable results.  The entry is defined in seconds and
  defaults to 120 (2 minutes).

\item[\Macro{SHUTDOWN\_FAST\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:ShutdownFastTimeout} This macro determines the maximum
  amount of time daemons are given to perform their
  fast shutdown procedure before the \Condor{master} kills them
  outright.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR}]
  \label{param:MasterBackoffFactor} If a daemon keeps crashing, an
  exponential back off waits longer and longer before
  restarting it.  At the end of this section, there is an example that
  shows how all these settings work.  This setting is the base of the
  exponent used to determine how long to wait before starting the
  daemon again.  It defaults to 2 seconds.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_CEILING}]
  \label{param:MasterBackoffCeiling} This entry determines the maximum
  amount of time you want the master to wait between attempts to start
  a given daemon.  (With 2.0 as the \MacroUNI{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR},
  1 hour is obtained in 12 restarts).  It is defined in terms of
  seconds and defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_RECOVER\_FACTOR}]
  \label{param:MasterRecoverFactor}  A macro to set how long a daemon 
  needs to run without crashing before it is considered \emph{recovered}.
  Once a
  daemon has recovered, the number of restarts is reset, so the
  exponential back off returns to its initial state.  
  The macro is defined in
  terms of seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

\end{description}

For clarity, the following is an example of the workings of
the exponential back off settings.  The example is worked out assuming
the default settings.

When a daemon crashes, it is restarted in 10 seconds.  If it keeps
crashing, a longer amount of time is waited before restarting.
The length of time is based on how
many times it has been restarted.  
Take the \MacroUNI{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_FACTOR} (defaults to 2) to 
the power the number of times the daemon has restarted, and add 9.
An example:
\begin{verbatim}
        1st crash:  restarts == 0, so, 9 + 2^0 = 9 + 1 = 10 seconds
        2nd crash:  restarts == 1, so, 9 + 2^1 = 9 + 2 = 11 seconds
        3rd crash:  restarts == 2, so, 9 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 seconds
        ...
        6th crash:  restarts == 5, so, 9 + 2^5 = 9 + 32 = 41 seconds
        ...
        9th crash:  restarts == 8, so, 9 + 2^8 = 9 + 256 = 265 seconds
\end{verbatim}

After the 13th crash, it would be:
\begin{verbatim}
        13th crash:  restarts == 12, so, 9 + 2^12 = 9 + 4096 = 4105 seconds
\end{verbatim}

This is bigger than the \MacroUNI{MASTER\_BACKOFF\_CEILING}, which
defaults to 3600, so the daemon would really be restarted after only
3600 seconds, not 4105.
The \Condor{master} tries again every hour (since the numbers would
get larger and would always be capped by the ceiling).
Eventually, imagine that daemon finally started and did not crash.
This might happen if, for example, an administrator reinstalled
an accidentally deleted binary after receiving e-mail about
the daemon crashing.
If it stayed alive for
\MacroUNI{MASTER\_RECOVER\_FACTOR} seconds (defaults to 5 minutes),
the count of how many restarts this daemon has performed is reset to
0.

The moral of the example is that 
the defaults work quite well, and you probably 
will not want to change them for any reason.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_NAME}] \label{param:MasterName}
  Defines a unique name given for a \Condor{master} daemon on a machine.
  Defaults to the fully qualified host name.
  If more than one \Condor{master} is running on the same host (for
  example, because of multiple Personal Condor installations running
  as different users) the \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} for each
  \Condor{master} should be defined to uniquely identify the separate
  daemons. 

  If the \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} contains more than a host name,
  it must
  have the form \verb$identifying-string@full.host.name$.
  If the string specified with \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} already includes
  an \verb$@$ sign, Condor will replace whatever follows the \verb$@$
  sign with the fully qualified host name of the local machine.
  If the string does not include an \verb$@$ sign,
  Condor will append one, followed by the host name.
  The \verb$identifying-string$ portion can contain any
  alphanumeric ASCII characters or punctuation marks except \verb$@$
  (which is used to delimit the name from the host name).
  We recommend that the string does not contain the \verb$:$
  character, since that might cause problems with certain tools.
  In the example of many Personal Condor installations on the same
  host, the user name that each \Condor{master} is executing as
  is, by convention,
  the \verb$identifying-string$.
  This is easily accomplished by setting
  \verb@MASTER_NAME = $(USERNAME)@ in the
  configuration file.

  If the \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} setting is used, and the
  \Condor{master} is configured to spawn a \Condor{schedd},
  the name
  defined with \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} takes precedence over the
  \Macro{SCHEDD\_NAME} setting (see section~\ref{param:ScheddName} on
  page~\pageref{param:ScheddName}). 
  Since Condor makes the assumption that there is only one
  instance of the \Condor{startd} running on a machine,
  the \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} is not automatically propagated to the
  \Condor{startd}.
  However, in situations where multiple \Condor{startd} daemons are
  running on the same host (for example, when using \Condor{glidein}),
  the \MacroNI{STARTD\_NAME} should be set to uniquely identify 
  the \Condor{startd} daemons
  (this is done automatically in the case of \Condor{glidein}).

  If a Condor daemon (master, schedd or startd) has been given a
  unique name, all Condor tools that need to contact that daemon can
  be told what name to use via the \Opt{-name} command-line option.


\item[\Macro{MASTER\_ATTRS}] \label{param:MasterExprs} This macro is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysExprs} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_ATTRS}.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_DEBUG}] \label{param:MasterDebug} This macro
  is described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:MasterAddressFile}
  This macro is described in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE} 

\item[\Macro{SECONDARY\_COLLECTOR\_LIST}]
  \label{param:SecondaryCollectorList} This macro lists the host names
  of secondary collectors.  A secondary collector is a machine
  running a \Condor{collector} daemon that is not the central manager.
  A secondary collector makes it possible to execute administrative
  commands in the pool when the central manager is down by using the
  \Opt{-pool} argument to specify the name of a secondary collector to
  use to locate the \Condor{master} daemon.

\item[\Macro{ALLOW\_ADMIN\_COMMANDS}]
  \label{param:AllowAdminCommands} If set to NO for a given host, this
  macro disables administrative commands, such as 
  \Condor{restart}, \Condor{on}, and \Condor{off}, to that host.

\item[\Macro{MASTER\_INSTANCE\_LOCK}] \label{param:MasterInstanceLock}
  Defines the name of a file for the \Condor{master} daemon
  to lock in order to prevent multiple \Condor{master}s
  from starting.
  This is useful when using shared file systems like NFS which do
  not technically support locking in the case where the lock files
  reside on a local disk.
  If this macro is not defined, the default file name will be
  \File{\$(LOCK)/InstanceLock}.
  \File{\$(LOCK)} can instead be defined to
  specify the location of all lock files, not just the 
  \Condor{master}'s \File{InstanceLock}.
  If \File{\$(LOCK)} is undefined, then the master log itself is locked.

\item[\Macro{ADD\_WINDOWS\_FIREWALL\_EXCEPTION}]
  \label{param:AddWindowsFirewallException} When set to \Expr{False}, the
  \Condor{master} will not automatically add Condor to the Windows
  Firewall list of trusted applications. Such trusted applications can
  accept incoming connections without interference from the firewall. This
  only affects machines running Windows XP SP2 or higher. The default
  is \Expr{True}.

\item[\Macro{WINDOWS\_FIREWALL\_FAILURE\_RETRY}]
  \label{param:WindowsFirewallFailureRetry} 
  An integer value (default value is 60) that represents
  the number of times the \Condor{master} will retry to add
  firewall exceptions.
  When a Windows machine boots
  up, Condor starts up by default as well. Under certain conditions, the
  \Condor{master} may have difficulty adding exceptions to the Windows
  Firewall because of a delay in other services starting up.
  Examples of services that may possibly be slow are the 
  SharedAccess service, the Netman service, or the Workstation service.
  This configuration variable allows administrators to set the number of
  times (once every 10 seconds) that the \Condor{master} will retry
  to add firewall exceptions. A value of 0 means that Condor will
  retry indefinitely.

\Note If you are running Condor on a multi-CPU machine, be sure
to also read section~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} on
page~\pageref{sec:Configuring-SMP} which describes how to set up and
configure Condor on SMP machines.

These settings control general operation of the \Condor{startd}.
Examples using these configuration macros,
as well as further explanation is found in
section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on
Configuring The Startd Policy.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{START}] \label{param:Start}  A boolean expression
  that, when \Expr{True}, indicates that the machine is willing
  to start running a Condor job.

\item[\Macro{SUSPEND}] \label{param:Suspend}  A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, causes Condor to suspend running
   a Condor job.
   The machine may still be claimed, but the job makes no further
   progress, and Condor does not generate a load on the machine.

\item[\Macro{PREEMPT}] \label{param:Preempt}   A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, causes Condor to not continue
   running a currently suspended job in favor of running a different one 
   (with higher priority or better rank).

\item[\Macro{CONTINUE}] \label{param:Continue}  A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, causes Condor to continue the execution
   of a suspended job.

\item[\Macro{KILL}] \label{param:Kill}  A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, causes Condor to immediately stop the
   execution of a currently running job, without delay, and
   without taking the time to produce a checkpoint (for a standard
   universe job).

\item[\Macro{RANK}] \label{param:Rank}  A floating point value
   that Condor uses to compare potential jobs.
   A larger value for a specific job ranks that job above
   others with lower values for \MacroNI{RANK}.

\item[\Macro{WANT\_SUSPEND}] \label{param:WantSuspend}  A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, defines that a currently running
   Condor job is to be suspended, instead of killed.

\item[\Macro{WANT\_VACATE}] \label{param:WantVacate}  A boolean expression
   that, when \Expr{True}, defines that a currently running
   Condor job is to be killed, instead of suspended.

\item[\Macro{IS\_OWNER}] \label{param:IsOwner}  A boolean expression that
   defaults to being defined as
\begin{verbatim}
        IS_OWNER = (START =?= FALSE)
\end{verbatim}
   Used to describe the state of the machine with respect to its use
   by its owner.
   Job ClassAd attributes are not used in defining \MacroNI{IS\_OWNER},
   as they would be \Expr{Undefined}.
\end{description}




\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{STARTER}] \label{param:Starter}  This macro holds the
  full path to the \Condor{starter} binary that the startd should 
  spawn.
  It is normally defined relative to \MacroUNI{SBIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{ALTERNATE\_STARTER\_1}] \label{param:AlternateStarter1}
  This macro holds the full path to the \Condor{starter.pvm}
  binary that the startd spawns to service PVM jobs.  It is normally
  defined relative to \MacroUNI{SBIN}, since by default,
  \Condor{starter.pvm} is installed in the regular Condor release
  directory. 
  
\item[\Macro{POLLING\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:PollingInterval} When a
  startd enters the claimed state, this macro determines how often
  the state of the machine is polled to check the need to suspend, resume,
  vacate or kill the job.  It is defined in terms of seconds and defaults to
  5.
  
\item[\Macro{UPDATE\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:UpdateInterval}
  Determines how often the startd should send a ClassAd update
  to the \Condor{collector}.  The startd also sends update on any
  state or activity change, or if the value of its \Expr{START} expression
  changes.  See section~\ref{sec:States} on \condor{startd}
  states, section~\ref{sec:Activities} on \condor{startd}
  Activities, and section~\ref{sec:Start-Expr} on \condor{startd}
  \Expr{START} expression for details on states, activities, and the
  \Expr{START} expression.  This macro is defined in
  terms of seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{MAX\_CLAIM\_ALIVES\_MISSED}]
  \label{param:MaxClaimAlivesMissed} The schedd sends periodic updates
  to each startd as a keep alive (see the description of
  \Macro{ALIVE\_INTERVAL} on page~\pageref{param:AliveInterval}).  
  If the startd does not receive any keep alive messages, it assumes
  that something has gone wrong with the schedd and that the resource
  is not being effectively used.
  Once this happens, the startd considers the claim to have timed out,
  it releases the claim, and starts advertising itself as available
  for other jobs.
  Because these keep alive messages are sent via UDP, they are
  sometimes dropped by the network.
  Therefore, the startd has some tolerance for missed keep alive
  messages, so that in case a few keep alives are lost, the startd
  will not immediately release the claim.
  This setting controls how many keep alive messages can be missed
  before the startd considers the claim no longer valid.
  The default is 6.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_HAS\_BAD\_UTMP}] \label{param:StartdHasBadUtmp}
  When the startd is computing the idle time of all the
  users of the machine (both local and remote), it checks the
  \File{utmp} file to find all the currently active ttys, and only
  checks access time of the devices associated with active logins.
  Unfortunately, on some systems, \File{utmp} is unreliable, and the
  startd might miss keyboard activity by doing this.  So, if your
  \File{utmp} is unreliable, set this macro to TRUE and the
  startd will check the access time on all tty and pty devices.
  
\item[\Macro{CONSOLE\_DEVICES}] \label{param:ConsoleDevices} This
  macro allows the startd to monitor console (keyboard and mouse)
  activity by checking the access times on special files in
  \File{/dev}.  Activity on these files shows up as 
  \AdAttr{ConsoleIdle}
  time in the startd's ClassAd.  Give a comma-separated list of
  the names of devices considered the console, without the
  \File{/dev/} portion of the pathname.  The defaults vary from
  platform to platform, and are usually correct.  

  One possible exception to this is on Linux, where
  we use ``mouse'' as
  one of the entries.  Most Linux installations put in a
  soft link from \File{/dev/mouse} that points to the appropriate
  device (for example, \File{/dev/psaux} for a PS/2 bus mouse, or
  \File{/dev/tty00} for a serial mouse connected to com1).  However,
  if your installation does not have this soft link, you will either
  need to put it in (you will be glad you did), or change this
  macro to point to the right device. 
  
  Unfortunately, there are no such devices on Digital Unix or IRIX
  (don't be fooled by \File{/dev/keyboard0}; the kernel does not
  update the access times on these devices), so this macro is not
  useful in these cases, and we must use the \Condor{kbdd} to get this
  information by connecting to the X server.
  
\item[\Macro{STARTD\_JOB\_EXPRS}] \label{param:StartdJobExprs} When
  the machine is claimed by a remote user, the startd can also advertise
  arbitrary attributes from the job ClassAd in the machine
  ClassAd.
  List the attribute names to be advertised.  \Note Since
  these are already ClassAd expressions, do not do anything
  unusual with strings.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_ATTRS}] \label{param:StartdAttrs} This macro is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysAttrs} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ATTRS}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_DEBUG}] \label{param:StartdDebug} This macro
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the startd) is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:StartdAddressFile}
  This macro is described in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \Macro{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE} 

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_SHOULD\_WRITE\_CLAIM\_ID\_FILE}] \label{param:StartdShouldWriteClaimIdFile}
  Starting with version 6.7.10, the \Condor{startd} can be configured
  to write out the \Attr{ClaimId} for the next available claim on all
  virtual machines to separate files.
  This boolean attribute controls whether the \Condor{startd} should
  write these files.
  The default value is true.
  
\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CLAIM\_ID\_FILE}] \label{param:StartdClaimIdFile}
  This macro controls what file names are used if the above
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_SHOULD\_WRITE\_CLAIM\_ID\_FILE} is true.  By
  default, Condor will write the ClaimId into a file in the
  \MacroU{LOG} directory called \File{.startd\_claim\_id.vmX}, where
  \verb@X@ is the value of \Attr{VirtualMachineID}, the integer that
  identifies a given virtual machine on the system, or \verb@1@ on a
  single-VM machine.
  If you define your own value for this setting, you should provide a
  full path, and Condor will automatically append the \verb@.vmX@
  portion of the file name.

\item[\Macro{NUM\_CPUS}] \label{param:NumCpus}
  This macro can be used to ``lie'' to the startd about how many CPUs
  your machine has.
  If you set this, it will override Condor's automatic computation of
  the number of CPUs in your machine, and Condor will use whatever
  integer you specify here. 
  In this way, you can allow multiple Condor jobs to run on a
  single-CPU machine by having that machine treated like an SMP
  machine with multiple CPUs, which could have different Condor jobs
  running on each one.
  Or, you can have an SMP machine advertise more virtual machines than
  it has CPUs.
  However, using this parameter will hurt the performance of the jobs,
  since you would now have multiple jobs running on the same CPU,
  competing with each other.
  The option is only meant for people who specifically want this
  behavior and know what they are doing.  
  It is disabled by default.

  \Note This setting cannot be changed with a simple reconfig (either
  by sending a SIGHUP or using \Condor{reconfig}.
  If you change this, you must restart the \Condor{startd} for the
  change to take effect (by using ``\condor{restart} -startd'').

  \Note If you use this setting on a given machine, you should
  probably advertise that fact in the machine's ClassAd by using the
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_ATTRS} setting (described above).
  This way, jobs submitted in your pool could specify that they did or
  did not want to be matched with machines that were only really
  offering ``fractional CPUs''.

\item[\Macro{COUNT\_HYPERTHREAD\_CPUS}] \label{param:CountHyperthreadCpus}
  This macro controls how Condor sees hyperthreaded
  processors. When set to TRUE (the default), it includes virtual CPUs in
  the default value of \MacroNI{NUM\_CPUS}. On dedicated cluster nodes, 
  counting virtual CPUs can sometimes improve total throughput at the expense 
  of individual job speed. However, counting them on desktop workstations can
  interfere with interactive job performance.

\item[\Macro{MEMORY}] \label{param:Memory}
  Normally, Condor will automatically detect the amount of physical
  memory available on your machine.  Define \MacroNI{MEMORY} to tell
  Condor how much physical memory (in MB) your machine has, overriding
  the value Condor computes automatically.

\item[\Macro{RESERVED\_MEMORY}] \label{param:ReservedMemory}
  How much memory would you like reserved from Condor?  By default,
  Condor considers all the physical memory of your machine as
  available to be used by Condor jobs.  If \MacroNI{RESERVED\_MEMORY} is
  defined, Condor subtracts it from the amount of memory it advertises
  as available.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_NAME}] \label{param:StartdName}
  Used to give an alternative name in the \Condor{startd}'s
  class ad.
  This esoteric configuration macro might be used in the situation
  where there are two \Condor{startd} daemons running on one machine,
  and each reports to the same \Condor{collector}.
  Different names will distinguish the two daemons.
  See the description of \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} in
  section~\ref{param:MasterName} on page~\pageref{param:MasterName}
  for a description of valid Condor daemon names.

\item[\Macro{RunBenchmarks}] \label{param:RunBenchmarks}
  Specifies when to run benchmarks.  When the machine is in the Unclaimed state and this expression evaluates to TRUE, benchmarks will be run.  If RunBenchmarks is specified and set to anything other than FALSE additional benchmarks will be run when the startd initially starts.  To disable startup benchmarks you must set \MacroNI{RunBenchmarks} to FALSE or comment it out of the configuration file.

\end{description}

These macros only apply to the \Condor{startd} daemon when it is running on an
SMP machine. 
See section~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} on
page~\pageref{sec:Configuring-SMP} on Configuring The Startd for 
SMP Machines for details.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{VIRTUAL\_MACHINES\_CONNECTED\_TO\_CONSOLE}] 
\label{param:VirtualMachinesConnectedToConsole}
  An integer which indicates how many of the virtual
  machines the startd is representing should be "connected" to the
  console (in other words, notice when there's console activity).
  This defaults to all virtual machines (N in a machine with N CPUs).

\item[\Macro{VIRTUAL\_MACHINES\_CONNECTED\_TO\_KEYBOARD}]
\label{param:VirtualMachinesConnectedToKeyboard}
  An integer which indicates how many of the virtual
  machines the startd is representing should be "connected" to the
  keyboard (for remote tty activity, as well as console activity).
  Defaults to 1.

\item[\Macro{DISCONNECTED\_KEYBOARD\_IDLE\_BOOST}]
\label{param:DisconnectedKeyboardIdleBoost}
  If there are virtual machines not connected to either the keyboard
  or the console, the corresponding idle time reported will be the
  time since the startd was spawned, plus the value of this macro.
  It defaults to 1200 seconds (20 minutes). 
  We do this because if the virtual machine is configured not to care
  about keyboard activity, we want it to be available to Condor jobs
  as soon as the startd starts up, instead of having to wait for 15
  minutes or more (which is the default time a machine must be idle
  before Condor will start a job).
  If you do not want this boost, set the value to 0.  
  If you change your START expression to require more than 15 minutes
  before a job starts, but you still want jobs to start right away on
  some of your SMP nodes, increase this macro's value.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_VM\_EXPRS}]
\label{param:StartdVMExprs}
  The list of ClassAd attribute names that should be shared across all
  virtual machines on the same machine.
  For each attribute in the list, the attribute's value is taken from
  each virtual machine's machine ClassAd and placed into the machine
  ClassAd of all the other virtual machines within the machine.
  For example, if the configuration file for a 2-VM machine
  contains
\begin{verbatim}
        STARTD_VM_EXPRS = State, Activity, EnteredCurrentActivity
\end{verbatim}
  then the machine ClassAd for both virtual machines will contain
  attributes that will be of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
     vm1_State = "Claimed"
     vm1_Activity = "Busy"
     vm1_EnteredCurrentActivity = 1075249233
     vm2_State = "Unclaimed"
     vm2_Activity = "Idle"
     vm2_EnteredCurrentActivity = 1075240035
\end{verbatim}


\end{description}

The following settings control the number of virtual machines reported
for a given SMP host, and what attributes each one has.  
They are only needed if you do not want to have an SMP machine report
to Condor with a separate virtual machine for each CPU, with all
shared system resources evenly divided among them.
Please read section~\ref{sec:SMP-Divide} on
page~\pageref{sec:SMP-Divide} for details on how to properly configure
these settings to suit your needs.

\Note You can only change the number of each type of virtual machine
the \Condor{startd} is reporting with a simple reconfig (such as
sending a SIGHUP signal, or using the \Condor{reconfig} command).
You cannot change the definition of the different virtual machine
types with a reconfig.  
If you change them, you must restart the \Condor{startd} for the
change to take effect (for example, using 
\Code{condor\_restart -startd}).

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{MAX\_VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_TYPES}]
\label{param:MaxVirtualMachineTypes}
  The maximum number of different virtual machine types.  
  Note: this is the maximum number of different \emph{types}, not of
  actual virtual machines.
  Defaults to 10.  
  (You should only need to change this setting if you define more than
  10 separate virtual machine types, which would be pretty rare.)

\item[\Macro{VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_TYPE\_<N>}]
\label{param:VirtualMachineTypeN}
  This setting defines a given virtual machine type, by specifying
  what part of each shared system resource (like RAM, swap space, etc)
  this kind of virtual machine gets.
  N can be any integer from 1 to the value of
  \MacroUNI{MAX\_VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_TYPES}, such as
  \MacroNI{VIRTUAL\_MACHINE\_TYPE\_1}. 
  The format of this entry can be somewhat complex, so please refer to
  section~\ref{sec:SMP-Divide} on page~\pageref{sec:SMP-Divide} for
  details on the different possibilities.

\item[\Macro{NUM\_VIRTUAL\_MACHINES\_TYPE\_<N>}]
\label{param:NumVirtualMachinesTypeN}
  This macro controls how many of a given virtual machine type
  are actually reported to Condor.
  There is no default.

\item[\Macro{NUM\_VIRTUAL\_MACHINES}]
\label{param:NumVirtualMachines}
  If your SMP machine is being evenly divided, and the virtual
  machine type settings described above are not being used, this
  macro controls how many virtual machines will be reported.  
  The default is one virtual machine for each CPU.
  This setting can be used to reserve some CPUs on an SMP which would
  not be reported to the Condor pool.

\end{description}

The following macros control the \Prog{cron} capabilities of Condor.
The \Prog{cron} mechanism is used to run executables (called
modules) directly from the \Condor{startd} daemon.
The output of these modules
is incorporated into the machine ClassAd generated by the
\Condor{startd}.  These capabilities are used in Hawkeye, but can be
used in other situations, as well.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}]
\label{param:StartdCronName}
  Defines a logical name to be used in the formation of related
  configuration macro names. While
  not required, this macro makes other macros
  more readable and maintainable.  A common example:
\begin{verbatim}
        STARTD_CRON_NAME = HAWKEYE
\end{verbatim}
  This example allows Condor to refer to other related macros
  with the string ``HAWKEYE'' in their name.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBLIST}]
\label{param:StartdCronJobList}

  This configuration variable is defined by a whitespace separated
  list of job names (called modules) to run.
  Each of these is the logical name of the module.  This name
  must be unique (no two modules may have the same name).

  If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
  is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBLIST} to
  \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_JOBLIST}.


\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PREFIX}]
\label{param:StartdCronModulePrefix}
    Specifies a string which is prepended by
    Condor to all attribute names that the module generates.  For
    example, if a prefix is ``xyz\_'', and an individual attribute is
    named ``abc'', the resulting attribute would be ``xyz\_abc''.
    Although it can be quoted, the prefix can contain only
    alpha-numeric characters.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PREFIX} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_PREFIX}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_EXECUTABLE}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleExecutable}
    Used to specify the full path to the
    executable to run for this module.  Note that multiple modules may
    specify the same executable (although they need to have different
    names).

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_EXECUTABLE} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_EXECUTABLE}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PERIOD}]
\label{param:StartdCronModulePeriod}
    The period specifies time intervals at
    which the module should be run.
    For periodic modules, this
    is the time interval that passes between starting the execution
    of the module.
    The value may be specified in seconds (append value with the
    character 's'), in minutes (append value with the character 'm'),
    or in hours (append value with the character 'h').
    As an example, 5m starts the execution of the module every five minutes.
    If no character is appended to the value, seconds are used as a default.
    For ``Wait For Exit'' mode, the value has a different meaning; in
    this case 
    the period specifies the length of time after the module ceases execution
    before it is restarted.
    The minimum valid value of the period is 1 second.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PERIOD} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_PERIOD}.


\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_MODE}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleMode}
    Used to specify the ``Mode'' in which the module operates.
    Legal values are ``WaitForExit'' and ``Periodic'' (the
    default).  

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_MODE} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_MODE}.

    The default ``Periodic'' mode is used for most modules.  In
    this mode, the module is expected to be started by the
    \Condor{startd} daemon, gather and publish it's data, and then
    exit.

    The ``WaitForExit'' mode is used to specify a module
    which runs in the ``Wait For Exit'' mode.
    In this mode, the \Condor{startd} daemon
    interprets the ``period'' differently.  In this case, it
    refers to the amount of time to wait after the module exits
    before restarting it.  With a value of 1, the module is kept
    running nearly continuously.

    In general, ``Wait For Exit'' mode is for modules that produce
    a periodic stream of updated data, but it can be used for other
    purposes, as well.


\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_RECONFIG}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleReconfig}
    The ``ReConfig'' macro is used to specify whether a module
    can handle HUP signals, and should be sent a HUP signal when
    the \Condor{startd} daemon is reconfigured.  The module is
    expected to reread it's configuration at that time.  A value
    of ``True'' enables this setting, and ``False'' disables it.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_RECONFIG} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_RECONFIG}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_KILL}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleKill}
    The ``Kill'' macro is applicable on for modules running in the
    ``Periodic'' mode.  Possible values are ``True'' and ``False'' (the
    default).

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_KILL} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_KILL}.

    This macro controls the behaviour of the \Condor{startd} when it
    detects that the module's executable is still running when it is time
    to start the module for a run. 	If enabled, the
    \Condor{startd} will kill and restart the process in this
    condition.  If not enabled, the existing process is allowed to
    continue running. 

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_ARGS}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleArgs}
    The command line arguments to pass to the module to be executed. 

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_ARGS} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_ARGS}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_ENV}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleEnv}
    The environment string to pass to the module.
    The syntax is the same as that of 
    \MacroNI{DAEMONNAME\_ENVIRONMENT} in ~\ref{param:DaemonNameEnvironment}.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_ENV} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_ENV}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_modulename\_CWD}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleCwd}
    The working directory in which to start the module.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_CWD} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_CWD}.

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_modulename\_OPTIONS}]
\label{param:StartdCronModuleOptions}
    A colon separated list of options. 
    Not all combinations of options make sense;
    when a nonsense combination is listed,
    the last one in the list is followed.

    If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}
    is defined, then this configuration macro name is changed from
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} to
    \MacroNI{\MacroUNI{STARTD\_CRON\_NAME}\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS}.

   \begin{itemize}

	\item The ``WaitForExit'' option enables the ``Wait For Exit''
	mode (see above).

	\item The ``ReConfig'' option enables the ``Reconfig'' setting
	(see above).

	\item The ``NoReConfig'' option disables the ``Reconfig'' setting
	(see above).

	\item The ``Kill'' option enables the ``Kill'' setting (see
	above).

	\item The ``NoKill'' option disables the ``Kill'' setting (see
	above).

    \end{itemize}

\Note This new syntax is hopefully less confusing.  Here's an example
use of it:
\begin{verbatim}
# Hawkeye Job Definitions
STARTD_CRON_NAME = HAWKEYE

# Job 1
HAWKEYE_JOBLIST = job1
HAKWEYE_job1_PREFIX = prefix_
HAKWEYE_job1_EXECUTABLE = $(MODULES)/job1
HAKWEYE_job1_PERIOD = 5m
HAKWEYE_job1_MODE = WaitForExit
HAKWEYE_job1_KILL = false
HAWKEYE_job1_ARGS =-foo -bar
HAWKEYE_job1_ENV = xyzzy=somevalue

# Job 2
HAWKEYE_JOBLIST = $(HAWKEYE_JOBLIST) job2
HAWKEYE_job2_PREFIX = prefix_
HAWKEYE_job2_EXECUTABLE = :$(MODULES)/job2
HAWKEYE_job2_PERIOD = 1h
HAWKEYE_job2_ENV = lwpi=somevalue
\end{verbatim}


\item[\Macro{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBS}]
\label{param:StartdCronJobs}
  The list of the modules to execute.  In Hawkeye, this is usually
  named HAWKEYE\_JOBS.

  Note: This syntax is now depricated, and replaced by the new
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBLIST} syntax (see above).
  For more information on the Cron logic, read the above discussion.
  If \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBLIST} is defined,
  \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBS} is ignored.

  This configuration variable is defined by
  a whitespace or newline separated list of jobs (called modules) to run, of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
	modulename:prefix:executable:period[:options]
\end{verbatim}
  Each of these fields can be surrounded by matching quote characters
  (single quote or double quote, but they must match).  This allows
  colon and whitespace characters to be specified.  For example, the
  following specifies an executable name with a colon and a space in it:
  \begin{verbatim}foo:foo_:''c:/some dir/foo.exe'':10m\end{verbatim}
  These individual fields are described below: \begin{itemize}

    \item \MacroNI{modulename} The logical name of the module.  This 
    must be unique (no two modules may have the same name).  See 
    \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_JOBLIST}

    \item \MacroNI{prefix}
    See \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PREFIX}

    \item \MacroNI{executable}
    See \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_EXECUTABLE}

    \item \MacroNI{period}
    See \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_PERIOD}

   \item Several options are available. Using more than one
   of these options for one module does not make sense.  If this happens,
   the last one in the list is followed. 
   See \MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item The ``Continuous'' option is used to specify a module
	which runs in continuous mode (as described above).  See the
	``WaitForExit'' and ``ReConfig'' options which replace
	``Continuous''.

	This option is now deprecated, and it's functionality has been
	replaced by the new ``WaitForExit'' and ``ReConfig'' options,
	which together implement the capabilities of ``Continuous''.
	This option will be removed from a future version of Condor.

	\item The ``WaitForExit'' option

	See the discussion of ``WaitForExit'' in
	\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} above.

	\item The ``ReConfig'' option

	See the discussion of ``ReConfig in
	\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} above.

	\item The `NoReConfig'' option

	See the discussion of ``NoReConfig in
	\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} above.

	\item The ``Kill'' option

	See the discussion of ``Kill'' in
	\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} above.

	\item The ``NoKill'' option

	See the discussion of ``NoKill'' in
	\MacroNI{STARTD\_CRON\_<ModuleName>\_OPTIONS} above.

    \end{itemize}
	
  \end{itemize}
\Note The configuration file parsing logic will strip whitespace from
the beginning and end of continuation lines.  Thus, a job list like
below will be misinterpreted and will not work as expected:
\begin{verbatim}
# Hawkeye Job Definitions
HAWKEYE_JOBS   =\
    JOB1:prefix_:$(MODULES)/job1:5m:nokill\
    JOB2:prefix_:$(MODULES)/job1_co:1h
HAWKEYE_JOB1_ARGS =-foo -bar
HAWKEYE_JOB1_ENV = xyzzy=somevalue
HAWKEYE_JOB2_ENV = lwpi=somevalue
\end{verbatim}
Instead, write this as below:
\begin{verbatim}
# Hawkeye Job Definitions
HAWKEYE_JOBS   =

# Job 1
HAWKEYE_JOBS = $(HAWKEYE_JOBS) JOB1:prefix_:$(MODULES)/job1:5m:nokill
HAWKEYE_JOB1_ARGS =-foo -bar
HAWKEYE_JOB1_ENV = xyzzy=somevalue

# Job 2
HAWKEYE_JOBS = $(HAWKEYE_JOBS) JOB2:prefix_:$(MODULES)/job2:1h
HAWKEYE_JOB2_ENV = lwpi=somevalue
\end{verbatim}



\end{description}

The following macros control the optional computation of resource
availability statistics in the startd.

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_COMPUTE\_AVAIL\_STATS}]
\label{param:StartdComputeAvailStats}
  A boolean that determines if the startd computes resource
  availability statistics.  The default is False.

If \Macro{STARTD\_COMPUTE\_AVAIL\_STATS} = True, the startd will
define the following ClassAd attributes for resources:

\begin{description}
\item[\AdAttr{AvailTime}]
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!AvailTime}
  The proportion of the time (between 0.0 and 1.0)
  that this resource has been in a state other than Owner.
\item[\AdAttr{LastAvailInterval}]
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!LastAvailInterval}
  The duration (in seconds) of the last period between Owner states.
\end{description}

The following attributes will also be included if the resource is
not in the Owner state:

\begin{description}
\item[\AdAttr{AvailSince}]
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!AvailSince}
  The time at which the resource last left the
  Owner state.  Measured in the number of seconds since the
  epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
\item[\AdAttr{AvailTimeEstimate}]
\index{ClassAd machine attribute!AvailTimeEstimate}
  Based on past history, an estimate
  of how long the current period between Owner states will last.
\end{description}

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_AVAIL\_CONFIDENCE}]
\label{param:StartdAvailConfidence}
  A floating point number representing the confidence level of the
  startd daemon's AvailTime estimate.
  By default, the estimate is based on
  the 80th percentile of past values
  (that is, the value is initially set to 0.8).

\item[\Macro{STARTD\_MAX\_AVAIL\_PERIOD\_SAMPLES}]
\label{param:StartdMaxAvailPeriodSamples}
  An integer that limits the number of samples of past available
  intervals stored by the startd to limit memory and disk consumption.
  Each sample requires 4 bytes of memory and approximately 10 bytes of
  disk space.

\end{description}


The following configuration variables support java universe jobs.

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{JAVA}]
\label{param:Java}
  The full path to the Java interpreter (the Java Virtual Machine).

\item[\Macro{JAVA\_MAXHEAP\_ARGUMENT}]
\label{param:JavaMaxheapArgument}
  An incomplete command line argument to the Java interpreter
  (the Java Virtual Machine)
  to specify the switch name for the Maxheap Argument.
  Condor uses it to construct the maximum heap size
  for the Java Virtual Machine. 
  For example, the value for the Sun JVM is \Arg{-Xmx}.

\item[\Macro{JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_ARGUMENT}]
\label{param:JavaClasspathArgument}
  The command line argument to the Java interpreter (the Java Virtual Machine)
  that specifies the Java Classpath.
  Classpath is a Java-specific term that denotes the list of
  locations (\File{.jar} files and/or directories)
  where the Java interpreter can
  look for the Java class files that a Java program requires.

\item[\Macro{JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_SEPARATOR}]
\label{param:JavaClasspathSeparator}
  The single character used to delimit constructed entries in the
  Classpath for the given operating system and Java Virtual Machine.
  If not defined, the operating system is queried for its default
  Classpath separator.

\item[\Macro{JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_DEFAULT}]
\label{param:JavaClasspathDefault}
  A list of path names to \File{.jar} files to be added to the Java Classpath 
  by default.
  The comma and/or space character delimits list entries.

\item[\Macro{JAVA\_EXTRA\_ARGUMENTS}]
\label{param:JavaExtraArguments}
  A list of additional arguments to be passed to the Java executable.
\end{description}

\condor{schedd} Configuration File Entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!condor\_schedd configuration variables}
These macros control the \Condor{schedd}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{SHADOW}] \label{param:Shadow} This macro determines the
  full path of the \Condor{shadow} binary that the \Condor{schedd}
  spawns.  It is normally defined in terms of \MacroUNI{SBIN}. 
  
\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_PVM}] \label{param:ShadowPvm} This macro
  determines the full path of the special \Condor{shadow.pvm} binary
  used for supporting PVM jobs that the \Condor{schedd} spawns.  It is
  normally defined in terms of \MacroUNI{SBIN}.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_JOBS\_RUNNING}] \label{param:MaxJobsRunning} This
  macro limits the number of processes spawned by a given
  \Condor{schedd}, for all job universes except the 
  globus [grid] universe.  See section~\ref{sec:Choosing-Universe}.
  This includes, but is not limited to \Condor{shadow} processes,
  and scheduler universe processes, including \Condor{dagman}.
  The actual
  number of \Condor{shadow}s may be less if you have reached
  your \MacroUNI{RESERVED\_SWAP} limit.
  When undefined, and therefore the default value,
  there is no maximum limit on the number of processes spawned.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_SHADOW\_EXCEPTIONS}]
  \label{param:MaxShadowExceptions} This macro controls the maximum
  number of times that \Condor{shadow} processes can have a fatal
  error (exception) before the \Condor{schedd} will relinquish
  the match associated with the dying shadow.  Defaults to 5.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:ScheddInterval}  This
  macro determines how often the \Condor{schedd} sends a ClassAd
  update to the \Condor{collector}.  It is defined in terms of seconds
  and defaults to 300 (every 5 minutes).

% \item[\Macro{REAL\_TIME\_JOB\_SUSPEND\_UPDATES}] 
%  \label{param:RealTimeJobSuspendUpdates}
%  If set to \Expr{True},
%  then the \Condor{shadow} will immediately update the
%  \Condor{schedd} upon the suspension or resumption of a job.
%  This allows \Condor{q} to show a
%  job in a suspended state in its default output.
%  In the \Expr{ST} column, there will be an \Expr{S} instead of an
%  \Expr{R} when the job is running, but suspended.

%  This attribute's real time connotation is currently applied only
%  to jobs in the vanilla, standard, and java universes.
%  Other universes may display a suspension state where applicable,
%  but the information may be stale.

%  The default value and when not present in the configuration
%  file is \Expr{False}.
  
\item[\Macro{JOB\_START\_COUNT}] \label{param:JobStartCount}
  This macro works together with the \Macro{JOB\_START\_DELAY} macro
  to throttle job starts.
  The default and minimum values for this
  integer configuration variable are both 1.
  Small values for this macro are preferred and will
  minimize the load upon the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
  
\item[\Macro{JOB\_START\_DELAY}] \label{param:JobStartDelay}
  This integer-valued macro works together with the
  \Macro{JOB\_START\_COUNT} macro
  to throttle job starts.  The  \Condor{schedd} daemon starts
  \MacroUNI{JOB\_START\_COUNT} jobs at a time, then delays for
  \MacroUNI{JOB\_START\_DELAY} seconds before starting the next set of jobs.
  This delay prevents a sudden, large load on the submit
  machine as it spawns many \Condor{shadow} daemons simultaneously,
  and it prevents having to deal
  with their start up activity all at once.
  The resulting job start rate
  averages as fast as
  (\MacroUNI{JOB\_START\_COUNT}/\MacroUNI{JOB\_START\_DELAY}) jobs/second.
  This configuration variable is also used during the graceful shutdown of the
  \Condor{schedd} daemon.
  During graceful shutdown, this macro determines the wait time in
  between requesting each \Condor{shadow} daemon to gracefully shut down.  
  It is defined in terms of seconds and defaults to 2.  
  Setting this macro to a lower value is not advised,
  as it can overwhelm the \Condor{schedd} daemon.

\item[\Macro{JOB\_IS\_FINISHED\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:JobIsFinishedInterval}
  The \Condor{schedd} maintains a list of jobs that are ready to permanently
  leave the job queue, e.g. they have completed or been removed.  This
  integer-valued macro specifies a delay in seconds to place between the
  taking jobs permanently out of the queue.  The default value is 0, which
  tells the schedd to not impose any delay.  
  
\item[\Macro{ALIVE\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:AliveInterval} This
  macro determines how often the \Condor{schedd} should send a keep
  alive message to any startd it has claimed.
  When the schedd claims a startd, it tells the startd how often it is
  going to send these messages.
  If the startd does not receive any of these keep alive messages
  during a certain period of time (defined via
  \Macro{MAX\_CLAIM\_ALIVES\_MISSED}, described on
  page~\pageref{param:MaxClaimAlivesMissed})
  the startd releases the claim, and the schedd no longer pays for
  the resource (in terms of user priority in the system).
  The macro is defined in terms of seconds and defaults to 300 (every
  5 minutes).

\item[\Macro{REQUEST\_CLAIM\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:RequestClaimTimeout} This macro sets the time (in
  seconds) that the schedd will wait for a claim to be granted by the
  startd.  The default is 30 minutes.  This is only likely to matter
  if the startd has an existing claim and it takes a long time for the
  existing claim to be preempted due to \Expr{MaxJobRetirementTime}.
  Once a request times out, the schedd will simply begin the process
  of finding a machine for the job all over again.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_SIZE\_ESTIMATE}] \label{param:ShadowSizeEstimate}
  This macro sets the estimated virtual memory size of each
  \Condor{shadow} process.  Specified in kilobytes.  The default
  varies from platform to platform.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}]
  \label{param:ShadowReniceIncrement} When the schedd spawns a new
  \Condor{shadow}, it can do so with a \Term{nice-level}.  A
  nice-level is a
  Unix mechanism that allows users to assign their own processes a lower 
  priority so that the processes do not interfere with interactive use of the
  machine.  This is very handy for keeping a submit machine with lots
  of shadows running still useful to the owner of the machine.  The
  value can be any integer between 0 and 19, with a value of 19 being
  the lowest priority.  It defaults to 10.

\item[\Macro{SCHED\_UNIV\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}]
  \label{param:SchedUnivReniceIncrement} Analogous to 
  \MacroNI{JOB\_RENICE\_INCREMENT} and
  \MacroNI{SHADOW\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}, scheduler universe jobs can
  be given a nice-level.
  See  \MacroNI{JOB\_RENICE\_INCREMENT} in
  section~\ref{param:JobReniceIncrement} for further explanation;
  default value and range of legal values are the same.

\item[\Macro{QUEUE\_CLEAN\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:QueueCleanInterval}
  The schedd maintains the job queue on a given machine.  It does so
  in a persistent way such that if the schedd crashes, it can recover
  a valid state of the job queue.  The mechanism it uses is a
  transaction-based log file (the \File{job\_queue.log} file,
  not the \File{SchedLog} file).  This file contains an initial
  state of the job queue, and a series of transactions that were
  performed on the queue (such as new jobs submitted, jobs completing,
  and checkpointing).  Periodically, the schedd will go through
  this log, truncate all the transactions and create a new file with
  containing only the new initial state of the log.
  This is a somewhat expensive operation,
  but it speeds up when the schedd restarts since there are
  fewer transactions it has to play to figure out what state the job
  queue is really in.  This macro determines how often the schedd
  should rework this queue to cleaning it up.  It is defined in terms of
  seconds and defaults to 86400 (once a day). 
  
\item[\Macro{WALL\_CLOCK\_CKPT\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:WallClockCkptInterval}
  The job queue contains a counter for each job's ``wall clock'' run
  time, i.e., how long each job has executed so far.  This counter is
  displayed by \Condor{q}.  The counter is updated when the job is
  evicted or when the job completes.  When the schedd crashes, the run
  time for jobs that are currently running will not be added to the
  counter (and so, the run time counter may become smaller than the
  cpu time counter).  The schedd saves run time ``checkpoints''
  periodically for running jobs so if the schedd crashes, only run
  time since the last checkpoint is lost.  This macro controls how
  often the schedd saves run time checkpoints.  It is defined in terms
  of seconds and defaults to 3600 (one hour).  A value of 0 will
  disable wall clock checkpoints.

\item[\Macro{ALLOW\_REMOTE\_SUBMIT}] \label{param:AllowRemoteSubmit}
  Starting with Condor Version 6.0, users can run \Condor{submit} on
  one machine and actually submit jobs to another machine in the
  pool.  This is called a \Term{remote submit}.  Jobs submitted in
  this way are entered into the job queue owned by the Unix user
  nobody.
  This macro determines whether this is allowed.
  It defaults to FALSE.
     
\item[\Macro{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS}] \label{param:QueueSuperUsers} This
  macro determines what user names on a given machine have
  \Term{super-user access} to the job queue, meaning that they can
  modify or delete the job ClassAds of other users.  (Normally, you
  can only modify or delete ClassAds from the job queue that you own).
  Whatever user name corresponds with the UID that Condor is running as
  (usually the Unix user condor) will automatically be included in this list
  because that is needed for Condor's proper functioning.  See
  section~\ref{sec:uids} on UIDs in Condor for more details on
  this.  By default, we give root the ability to remove other
  user's jobs, in addition to user condor.
      
\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_LOCK}] \label{param:ScheddLock} This macro
  specifies what lock file should be used for access to the
  \File{SchedLog} file.  It must be a separate file from the
  \File{SchedLog}, since the \File{SchedLog} may be rotated and
  synchronization across log file rotations
  is desired.
  This macro is defined relative to the \MacroUNI{LOCK} macro.
  If you decide to change this setting (not recommended),
  be sure to change the \MacroUNI{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry that
  \Condor{preen} uses as well.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_NAME}] \label{param:ScheddName}
  A unique name given for a \Condor{schedd} daemon on a machine.
  Defaults to the fully qualified hostname of the machine where the
  \Condor{schedd} is running.
  However, this configuration macro is used to uniquely identify
  \Condor{schedd} ClassAds if more than one \Condor{schedd} is running
  on the same host, for example, with many Personal Condor
  installations running as different users on the same machine.
  In that case, the recommended form for \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_NAME} is
  \verb$username@full.host.name$, where \verb$username$ is the
  user that a given \Condor{schedd} is running as. 

  See the description of \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} in
  section~\ref{param:MasterName} on page~\pageref{param:MasterName}
  for a description of valid Condor daemon names.
  Also, note that if the \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} setting is defined for
  the \Condor{master} that spawned a given \Condor{schedd}, that name
  will take precedence over whatever is defined in
  \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_NAME}. 

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_ATTRS}] \label{param:ScheddAttrs} This macro is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysExprs} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_ATTRS}.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ScheddDebug} This macro
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the schedd) is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_ADDRESS\_FILE}] \label{param:ScheddAddressFile}
  This macro is described in
  section~\ref{param:SubsysAddressFile} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_ADDRESS\_FILE}. 

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXECUTE}] \label{param:ScheddExecute}
  A directory to use as a temporary sandbox for local universe jobs.
  Defaults to \File{\MacroUNI{SPOOL}/execute}.

\item[\Macro{FLOCK\_NEGOTIATOR\_HOSTS}] \label{param:FlockNegotiatorHosts} 
  This macro defines a list of negotiator host names (not including the
  local \MacroUNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} machine) for pools in which the
  schedd should attempt to run jobs.  Hosts in the list should be in
  order of preference.  The schedd will only send a request to a
  central manager in the list if the local pool and pools earlier in
  the list are not satisfying all the job requests.
  \MacroUNI{HOSTALLOW\_NEGOTIATOR\_SCHEDD} (see
  section~\ref{param:HostAllow}) must also be configured to allow
  negotiators from all of the \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_NEGOTIATOR\_HOSTS} to
  contact the schedd.  Please make sure the
  \MacroUNI{NEGOTIATOR\_HOST} is first in the
  \MacroUNI{HOSTALLOW\_NEGOTIATOR\_SCHEDD} list.  Similarly, the
  central managers of the remote pools must be configured to listen to
  requests from this schedd.

\item[\Macro{FLOCK\_COLLECTOR\_HOSTS}] \label{param:FLockCollectorHosts}
  This macro defines a list of collector host names for pools in which
  the schedd should attempt to run jobs.  The
  collectors must be specified in order, corresponding to the
  \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_NEGOTIATOR\_HOSTS} list.  In the typical case, where each pool
  has the collector and negotiator running on the same machine,
  \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_COLLECTOR\_HOSTS} should have the same definition as
  \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_NEGOTIATOR\_HOSTS}.

% No longer needed as of 6.5.2.  Now done automatically.
%\item[\Macro{FLOCK\_VIEW\_SERVERS}] \label{param:FlockViewServers}
% This macro defines a list of hostnames where the condor-view server
% is running in the pools to which you want your jobs to flock.  The
% order of this list must correspond to the order of the
% \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_COLLECTOR\_HOSTS} and
% \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_NEGOTIATOR\_HOSTS} lists.  List items may be empty
% for pools which don't use a separate condor-view server.
% \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_VIEW\_SERVER} may be left undefined if no remote
% pools use separate condor-view servers.  Note: It is required that
% the same hostname does not appear twice in the
% \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_VIEW\_SERVERS} list and that the
% \MacroUNI{CONDOR\_VIEW\_HOST} does not appear in the
% \MacroUNI{FLOCK\_VIEW\_SERVERS} list.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATE\_ALL\_JOBS\_IN\_CLUSTER}]
  \label{param:NegotiateAllJobsInCluster}
  If this macro is set to False (the default), when the schedd fails
  to start an idle job, it will not try to start any other
  idle jobs in the same cluster during that negotiation cycle.  This
  makes negotiation much more efficient for large job clusters.
  However, in some cases other jobs in the cluster can be started even
  though an earlier job can't.  For example, the jobs' requirements
  may differ, because of different disk space, memory, or
  operating system requirements.  Or, machines may be willing to run
  only some jobs in the cluster, because their requirements reference
  the jobs' virtual memory size or other attribute.  Setting this
  macro to True will force the schedd to try to start all idle jobs in
  each negotiation cycle.  This will make negotiation cycles last
  longer, but it will ensure that all jobs that can be started will be
  started.

\item[\Macro{PERIODIC\_EXPR\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:PeriodicExprInterval} This macro determines the period,
  in seconds, between evaluation of periodic job control expressions,
  such as periodic\_hold, periodic\_release, and periodic\_remove,
  given by the user in a Condor submit file. By default, this value is
  300 seconds (5 minutes).  A value of 0 prevents the schedd from
  performing the periodic evaluations.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_ASSUME\_NEGOTIATOR\_GONE}]
  \label{param:ScheddAssumeNegotiatorGone} This macro determines the period,
  in seconds, that the \Condor{schedd} will wait for the \Condor{negotiator} to
  initiate a negotiation cycle before the schedd will simply try to claim
  any local \Condor{startd}.  This allows for a machine that is acting as
  both a submit and execute node to run jobs locally if it cannot
  communicate with the central manager.  The default value, if not
  specified, is 4 x \MacroUNI{NEGOTIATOR\_INTERVAL}.  If
  \MacroUNI{NEGOTIATOR\_INTERVAL} is not defined, then 
  \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_ASSUME\_NEGOTIATOR\_GONE} will default to 1200 (20
  minutes).

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_BACKUP\_SPOOL}]
  \label{param:ScheddBackupSpool} This macro is used to enable the
  \Condor{schedd} to make a backup of the job queue as it starts.  If
  set to ``True'', the \Condor{schedd} will create host specific a
  backup of the current spool file to the spool directory.  This
  backup file will be overwritten each time the \Condor{schedd}
  starts.  \Macro{SCHEDD\_BACKUP\_SPOOL} defaults to ``False''.

\item[\Macro{MPI\_CONDOR\_RSH\_PATH}]
  \label{param:MPICondorRshPath} The complete path to the
  special version of \Prog{rsh} that is required to spawn MPI
  jobs under Condor.
  \MacroU{LIBEXEC} is the proper value for this 
  configuration variable, required when running MPI dedicated jobs.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS}]
  \label{param:ScheddPreemptionRequirements}
  This boolean expression is
  utilized only for machines allocated by a dedicated scheduler.
  When \Expr{True}, a machine becomes a candidate for job preemption.
  This configuration variable has no default;
  when not defined, preemption will never be considered.

\item[\Macro{SCHEDD\_PREEMPTION\_RANK}]
  \label{param:ScheddPreemptionRank}
  This floating point value is
  utilized only for machines allocated by a dedicated scheduler.
  It is evaluated in context of a job ClassAd,
  and it represents a machine's preference for running a job.
  This configuration variable has no default;
  when not defined, preemption will never be considered.

\index{configuration!condor\_shadow configuration variables}
These settings affect the \Condor{shadow}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_LOCK}] \label{param:ShadowLock} This macro
  specifies the lock file to be used for access to the
  \File{ShadowLog} file.  It must be a separate file from the
  \File{ShadowLog}, since the \File{ShadowLog} may be rotated 
  and you want to synchronize access across log file rotations.
  This macro is defined relative to the \MacroUNI{LOCK} macro.
  If you decide to change this setting (not recommended),
  be sure to change the \MacroUNI{VALID\_LOG\_FILES} entry that
  \Condor{preen} uses as well.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_DEBUG}] \label{param:ShadowDebug} This macro
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the shadow) is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{SHADOW\_QUEUE\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:ShadowQueueUpdateInterval}
The amount of time (in seconds) between ClassAd updates that the
\Condor{shadow} daemon sends to the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
Defaults to 900 (15 minutes).

\item[\Macro{COMPRESS\_PERIODIC\_CKPT}]
  \label{param:CompressPeriodicCkpt} This boolean macro specifies
  whether the shadow should instruct applications to compress periodic
  checkpoints (when possible).  The default is FALSE.

\item[\Macro{COMPRESS\_VACATE\_CKPT}]
  \label{param:CompressVacateCkpt} This boolean macro specifies
  whether the shadow should instruct applications to compress vacate
  checkpoints (when possible).  The default is FALSE.

\item[\Macro{PERIODIC\_MEMORY\_SYNC}] \label{param:PeriodicMemorySync}
  This boolean macro specifies whether the shadow should instruct
  applications to commit dirty memory pages to swap space during a
  periodic checkpoint.  The default is FALSE.  This potentially
  reduces the number of dirty memory pages at vacate time, thereby
  reducing swapping activity on the remote machine.

\item[\Macro{SLOW\_CKPT\_SPEED}] \label{param:SlowCkptSpeed}  This
  macro specifies the speed at which vacate checkpoints should be
  written, in kilobytes per second.  If zero (the default), vacate
  checkpoints are written as fast as possible.  Writing vacate
  checkpoints slowly can avoid overwhelming the remote machine with
  swapping activity.

These macros control the \Condor{shadow.pvm}, the special shadow
that supports PVM jobs inside Condor.  See
section~\ref{sec:Install-PVM-Condor} on Installing PVM Support in
Condor for details.  \Condor{shadow} macros also apply to this
special shadow.  See section~\ref{sec:Shadow-Config-File-Entries}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{PVMD}] \label{param:PvmD}  This macro holds the full path
  to the special \Condor{pvmd}, the Condor PVM daemon.  This daemon is
  installed in the regular Condor release directory by default, so the
  macro is usually defined in terms of \MacroUNI{SBIN}.
  
\item[\Macro{PVMGS}] \label{param:PvmGS} This macro holds the full
  path to the special \Condor{pvmgs}, the Condor PVM Group Server
  daemon, which is needed to support PVM groups.  This daemon is
  installed in the regular Condor release directory by default, so the
  macro is usually defined in terms of \MacroUNI{SBIN}.

\index{configuration!condor\_starter configuration variables}
These settings affect the \Condor{starter}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{EXEC\_TRANSFER\_ATTEMPTS}] \label{param:ExecTransferAttempts}
  Sometimes due to a router misconfiguration, kernel bug, or other Act
  of God network problem, the transfer of the initial checkpoint from
  the submit machine to the execute machine will fail midway through.
  This parameter allows a retry of the transfer a certain number of times
  that must be equal to or greater than 1. If this parameter is not
  specified, or specified incorrectly, then it will default to three.
  If the transfer of the initial executable fails every attempt, then
  the job goes back into the idle state until the next renegotiation
  cycle.

  \Note: This parameter does not exist in the NT starter.

\item[\Macro{JOB\_RENICE\_INCREMENT}] \label{param:JobReniceIncrement}
  When the \Condor{starter} spawns a Condor job, it can do so with a
  \Term{nice-level}.
  A nice-level is a
  Unix mechanism that allows users to assign their own processes a lower 
  priority, such that these processes do not interfere with interactive
  use of the machine.
  If you have machines with lots
  of real memory and swap space, so that the only scarce resource is CPU time,
  you may use this macro in conjunction with a policy that
  allows Condor to always start jobs on the machines. 
  Condor jobs would always run,
  but interactive response on your machines would never suffer.
  You most likely will not notice Condor is
  running jobs.  See section~\ref{sec:Configuring-Policy} on
  Configuring The Startd Policy for more details on setting up a
  policy for starting and stopping jobs on a given machine.

  The value is an arbitrary ClassAd expression,
  evaluated by the \Condor{starter} daemon for each job just before the
  job runs, and the expression can refer to any attribute in the job ClassAd.
  The range of allowable values are integers in the range of 0 to 19
  (inclusive),
  with a value of 19 being the lowest priority.  
  If the expression evaluates to a value outside this range,
  then on a Unix machine, a value greater than 19 is auto-decreased to 19;
  a value less than 0 is treated as 0.
  For values outside this range, a Windows machine ignores the value
  and uses the default instead.
  The default value is 10, which maps to the idle priority class on
  a Windows machine.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_LOCAL\_LOGGING}]
  \label{param:StarterLocalLogging} This macro determines whether the
  starter should do local logging to its own log file, or send debug
  information back to the \Condor{shadow} where it will end up in the
  ShadowLog.  It defaults to TRUE.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_DEBUG}] \label{param:StarterDebug} This setting
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the starter) is
  described above in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \MacroUNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_UPDATE\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:StarterUpdateInterval}
The amount of time (in seconds) between ClassAd updates that the
\Condor{starter} daemon sends to the \Condor{shadow} daemon.
Defaults to 1200 (20 minutes).

\item[\Macro{USER\_JOB\_WRAPPER}] \label{param:UserJobWrapper} 
  The full path to an executable or script.
  This macro
  allows an administrator to specify a wrapper script to handle the
  execution of all user jobs.  
  If specified, Condor never directly executes a job, but instead
  invokes the program specified by this macro.
  The command-line arguments passed to this program will include the
  full-path to the actual user job which should be executed, followed by all
  the command-line parameters to pass to the user job.
  This wrapper program must ultimately replace its image with the user job;
  in other words,
  it must \Procedure{exec} the user job, not \Procedure{fork} it.
  For instance, if the wrapper program is a C/Korn shell script, the
  last line of execution should be:
\begin{verbatim}
        exec $*
\end{verbatim}
  This can potentially lose information about the arguments.
  Any argument with embedded whitespace will be split into multiple
  arguments.
  For example the argument "argument one" will become the two arguments
  "argument" and "one".
  For Bourne type shells (sh, bash, ksh),
  the following preserves the arguments:
\begin{verbatim}
        exec "$@"
\end{verbatim}
  For the C type shells (csh, tcsh), the following preserves the
  arguments:
\begin{verbatim}
        exec $*:q
\end{verbatim}


  For Windows machines, the wrapper will either be
  a batch script (with a file extension of \File{.bat} or \File{.cmd})
  or an executable (with a file extension of \File{.exe} or \File{.com}).

\item[\Macro{USE\_VISIBLE\_DESKTOP}] \label{param:UseVisibleDesktop} 
  This setting is only meaningful on Windows machines.  If True, Condor will
  allow the job to create windows on the desktop of the execute machine and
  interact with the job.  This is particularly useful for debugging why an
  application will not run under Condor.  If False, Condor uses the default
  behavior of creating a new, non-visible desktop to run the job on.
  See section~\ref{sec:platform-windows} for details on how Condor 
  interacts with the desktop.

\item[\Macro{STARTER\_JOB\_ENVIRONMENT}] \label{param:StarterJobEnvironment}
  This macro sets the default environment inherited by jobs.  The syntax is
  the same as the syntax for environment settings in the job submit file.
  If the same environment variable is assigned by this macro and by the user
  in the submit file, the user's setting takes precedence.

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_UNIVERSE}] \label{param:DefaultUniverse}
The universe under which a job is executed may be specified in the submit
description file.
If it is not specified in the submit description file, then
this variable specifies the universe (when defined).
If the universe is not specified in the submit description
file, and if this variable is not defined, then
the default universe for a job will be the standard universe.
\end{description}

If you want \Condor{submit} to automatically append an expression to
the \AdAttr{Requirements} expression or \AdAttr{Rank} expression of 
jobs at your site use the following macros:
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA}] \label{param:AppendReqVanilla}
  Expression to be appended to vanilla job requirements.
  
\item[\Macro{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD}] \label{param:AppendReqStandard}
  Expression to be appended to standard job requirements.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_REQUIREMENTS}] \label{param:AppendReq}
  Expression to be appended to any type of universe jobs. 
  However, if \MacroNI{APPEND\_REQ\_VANILLA} or \MacroNI{APPEND\_REQ\_STANDARD}
  is defined, then ignore the \MacroNI{APPEND\_REQUIREMENTS} for those
  universes.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_RANK}] \label{param:AppendRank}
  Expression to be appended to job rank.  \MacroNI{APPEND\_RANK\_STANDARD} or
    \MacroNI{APPEND\_RANK\_VANILLA} will override this setting if defined.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_STANDARD}] \label{param:AppendRankStandard}
  Expression to be appended to standard job rank.

\item[\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_VANILLA}] \label{param:AppendRankVanilla}
  Expression to append to vanilla job rank.

\end{description}

\Note The \Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_STANDARD} and 
\Macro{APPEND\_RANK\_VANILLA} macros were called
\Macro{APPEND\_PREF\_STANDARD} and
\Macro{APPEND\_PREF\_VANILLA} in previous versions of Condor.

In addition, you may provide default \AdAttr{Rank} expressions if your users
do not specify their own with:

\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_RANK\_VANILLA}] \label{param:DefaultRankVanilla}
  Default Rank for vanilla jobs.  

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_RANK\_STANDARD}] \label{param:DefaultRankStandard}
  Default Rank for standard jobs.


\end{description}

Both of these macros default to the jobs preferring machines where
there is more main memory than the image size of the job, expressed
as:
\begin{verbatim}
        ((Memory*1024) > Imagesize)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_IO\_BUFFER\_SIZE}] \label{param:DefaultBufferSize}
  Condor keeps a buffer of recently-used data for each file an
  application opens.  This macro specifies the default maximum number
  of bytes to be buffered for each open file at the executing machine.
  The \Condor{status} \MacroNI{buffer\_size} command will override this
  default.  If this macro is undefined, a default size of 512 KB will
  be used.

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_IO\_BUFFER\_BLOCK\_SIZE}] 
  \label{param:DefaultBufferBlockSize} When buffering is enabled,
  Condor will attempt to consolidate small read and write operations
  into large blocks.  This macro specifies the default block size
  Condor will use.  The \Condor{status} \MacroNI{buffer\_block\_size}
  command will override this default.  If this macro is undefined, a
  default size of 32 KB will be used.

\item[\Macro{SUBMIT\_SKIP\_FILECHECK}] \label{param:SubmitSkipFilecheck}
  If True, \Condor{submit} behaves as if the \Opt{-d} 
  command-line option is used.
  This tells \Condor{submit} to disable file permission checks when
  submitting a job.
  This can significantly decrease the amount of time required to submit
  a large group of jobs.
  The default value is False.

\item[\Macro{SUBMIT\_SEND\_RESCHEDULE}] \label{param:SubmitSendReschedule}
  A boolean expression that when False, prevents \Condor{submit} from
  automatically sending a \Condor{reschedule} command as it completes.
  The \Condor{reschedule} command causes the \Condor{schedd} daemon
  to start searching for machines with which to match the submitted
  jobs.  When True, this step always occurs.
  In the case that the machine where the job(s) are submitted is
  managing a huge number of jobs (thousands or tens of thousands),
  this step would hurt performance in such a way that it became
  an obstacle to scalability.
  The default value is True.

\item[\Macro{SUBMIT\_EXPRS}] \label{param:SubmitExprs}
  The given comma-separated, named expressions are inserted into all 
  the job ClassAds that \Condor{submit} creates.  This is equivalent
  to the ``+'' syntax in submit files.  See the
  the \Condor{submit} manual page
  on page~\pageref{man-condor-submit} for details on using the ``+''
  syntax to add attributes to the job ClassAd.
  Attributes defined in the submit description file with ``+'' will
  override attributes defined in the config file with
  \MacroNI{SUBMIT\_EXPRS}.

\item[\Macro{VALID\_LOG\_FILES}] \label{param:ValidLogFiles} This
  macro contains a (comma or space separated) list of files that
  \Condor{preen} considers valid files to find in the \MacroUNI{LOG}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!condor\_collector configuration variables}
These macros affect the \Condor{collector}.
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{CLASSAD\_LIFETIME}] \label{param:ClassadLifetime} This
  macro determines how long a ClassAd can remain in the collector
  before it is discarded as stale information.  The ClassAds sent to
  the collector might also have an attribute that says how long the
  lifetime should be for that specific ad.  If that attribute is
  present, the collector will either use it or the
  \MacroUNI{CLASSAD\_LIFETIME}, whichever is greater.  The macro is
  defined in terms of seconds, and defaults to 900 (15 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{MASTER\_CHECK\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:MasterCheckInterval}  This macro defines how often the
  collector should check for machines that have ClassAds from some
  daemons, but not from the \Condor{master} (\Term{orphaned daemons})
  and send e-mail about it.  It is defined in seconds and 
  defaults to 10800 (3 hours).

\item[\Macro{CLIENT\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:ClientTimeout} Network
  timeout that the \Condor{collector} uses when talking to any daemons
  or tools that are sending it a ClassAd update.
  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 30.
  
\item[\Macro{QUERY\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:QueryTimeout} Network
  timeout when talking to anyone doing a query. It is defined in seconds
  and defaults to 60.
  
\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS}] \label{param:CondorDevelopers}
  By default,
  Condor will send e-mail once per week to this address with the output
  of the \Condor{status} command, which lists how many machines
  are in the pool and how many are running jobs.  The default
  value of \Email{condor-admin@cs.wisc.edu} will send this report to
  the Condor Team developers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
  The Condor Team uses
  these weekly status messages in order to have some idea as to how
  many Condor pools exist in the world.  We appreciate
  getting the reports, as this is one way we can convince funding
  agencies that Condor is being used in the real world.  
  If you do not wish this information to be sent to the Condor Team,
  explicitly set the value to \Expr{NONE} to disable this feature,
  or replace the
  address with a desired location.  
  If undefined (commented out) in the configuration file, Condor follows
  its default behavior.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_NAME}] \label{param:CollectorName}
  This macro is used to specify a short description of your pool.
  It should be about 20 characters long.  For example, the name of the
  UW-Madison Computer Science Condor Pool is ``UW-Madison CS''.  
  While this macro might seem similar to \MacroNI{MASTER\_NAME} or
  \MacroNI{SCHEDD\_NAME}, it is totally unrelated.
  Those settings are used to unique identify (and locate) a specific
  set of Condor daemons if there are more than one running on the same
  machine.
  The \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_NAME} setting is just used as a
  human-readable string to describe the pool, which is included in the
  updates set to the \MacroNI{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS\_COLLECTOR} (see
  below). 

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS\_COLLECTOR}]
  \label{param:CondorDevelopersCollector} By default, every pool sends
  periodic updates to a central \Condor{collector} at UW-Madison with
  basic information about the status of your pool.  This includes only
  the number of total machines, the number of jobs submitted, the
  number of machines running jobs, the host name of your central
  manager, and the \MacroUNI{COLLECTOR\_NAME} specified above.  These
  updates help the Condor Team see how Condor is being used around the world.
  By default, they will be sent to \File{condor.cs.wisc.edu}.
  If you do not want
  these updates to be sent from your pool,
  explicitly set this macro to \Expr{NONE}. 
  If undefined (commented out) in the configuration file, Condor follows
  its default behavior.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_BUFSIZE}] 
  \label{param:CollectorSocketBufsize} This specifies the buffer size, in
  bytes, reserved for \Condor{collector} network sockets.  The default is
  1024000, or a one megabyte buffer.  This is a healthy size, even for a large
  pool.  The larger this value, the less likely the \Condor{collector} will
  have stale information about the pool due to dropping update packets.  If
  your pool is small or your central manager has very little RAM, considering
  setting this parameter to a lower value (perhaps 256000 or 128000).

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE}] 
  \label{param:CollectorSocketCacheSize} 
  If your site wants to use TCP connections to send ClassAd updates to
  the collector, you must use this setting to enable a cache of TCP
  sockets (in addition to enabling
  \Macro{UPDATE\_COLLECTOR\_WITH\_TCP}). 
  Please read section~\ref{sec:tcp-collector-update} on ``Using TCP to
  Send Collector Updates'' on page~\pageref{sec:tcp-collector-update}
  for more details and a discussion of when you would need this
  functionality. 
  If you do not enable a socket cache, TCP updates will be refused by
  the collector.
  The default value for this setting is 0, with no cache enabled.   
  If you lower this number, you must run \Condor{restart} and not just
  \Condor{reconfig} for the change to take effect.

\item[\Macro{KEEP\_POOL\_HISTORY}] \label{param:KeepPoolHistory}
  This boolean macro is used to decide if the collector will write
  out statistical information about the pool to history files. The default
  is FALSE. The location, size and frequency of history logging is controlled
  by the other macros.

\item[\Macro{POOL\_HISTORY\_DIR}] \label{param:PoolHistoryDir}
  This macro sets the name of the directory where the history
  files reside (if history logging is enabled).
  The default is the \File{SPOOL} directory.

\item[\Macro{POOL\_HISTORY\_MAX\_STORAGE}]
  \label{param:PoolHistoryMaxStorage} 
  This macro sets the maximum combined size of the history files.
  When the size of the history files is close to this limit, the oldest
  information will be discarded.
  Thus, the larger this parameter's value is, the larger the time
  range for which history will be available.  The default value is
  10000000 (10 Mbytes).

\item[\Macro{POOL\_HISTORY\_SAMPLING\_INTERVAL}]
  \label{param:PoolHistorySamplingInterval}
  This macro sets the interval, in seconds, between samples for
  history logging purposes. 
  When a sample is taken, the collector goes through the information
  it holds, and summarizes it.
  The information is written to the history file once for each 4
  samples.
  The default (and recommended) value is 60 seconds. Setting this
  macro's value too low will increase the load on the collector,
  while setting it to high will produce less precise statistical
  information.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_DAEMON\_STATS}]
  \label{param:CollectorDaemonStats}
  This macro controls whether or not the Collector keeps update
  statistics on incoming updates.  The default value is True.  If
  this option is enabled, the collector will insert several attributes
  into ClassAds that it stores and sends.  ClassAds without the
  ``UpdateSequenceNumber'' and ``DaemonStartTime'' attributes will not
  be counted, and will not have attributes inserted (all modern Condor
  daemons which publish ClassAds publish these attributes).

  The attributes inserted are ``UpdatesTotal'', ``UpdatesSequenced'',
  and ``UpdatesLost''.  ``UpdatesTotal'' is the total number of
  updates (of this ad type) the Collector has received from this host.
  ``UpdatesSequenced'' is the number of updates that the Collector
  could have as lost.  In particular, for the first update from a
  daemon it's impossible to tell if any previous ones have been lost
  or not.  ``UpdatesLost'' is the number of updates that the Collector
  has detected as being lost.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_DAEMON\_HISTORY\_SIZE}]
  \label{param:CollectorDaemonHistorySize} This macro controls the
  size of the published update history that the Collector inserts into
  the ClassAds it stores and sends.  The default value is 128, which
  means that history is stored and published for the latest 128
  updates.  This macro is ignored if \MacroU{COLLECTOR\_DAEMON\_STATS}
  is not enabled.

  If this has a non-zero value, the Collector will insert
  ``UpdatesHistory'' into the ClassAd (similar to ``UpdatesTotal''
  above).  ``UpdatesHistory'' is a hexadecimal string which represents
  a bitmap of the last \Macro{COLLECTOR\_DAEMON\_HISTORY\_SIZE}
  updates.  The most significant bit (MSB) of the bitmap represents the
  most recent update, and the least significant bit (LSB) represents
  the least recent.  A value of zero means that the update was not
  lost, and a value of 1 indicates that the update was detected as
  lost.

  For example, if the last update was not lost, the previous lost, and
  the previous two not, the bitmap would be 0100, and the matching hex
  digit would be ``4''.  Note that the MSB can never be marked as lost
  because it's loss can only be detected by a non-lost update (a
  ``gap'' is found in the sequence numbers).  Thus, UpdatesHistory =
  "0x40" would be the history for the last 8 updates.  If the next
  updates are all successful, the values published, after each update,
  would be: 0x20, 0x10, 0x08, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_CLASS\_HISTORY\_SIZE}]
  \label{param:CollectorClassHistorySize} This macro controls the
  size of the published update history that the Collector inserts into
  the Collector ClassAds it produces.  The default value is zero.

  If this has a non-zero value, the Collector will insert
  ``UpdatesClassHistory'' into the Collector ClassAd (similar to
  ``UpdatesHistory'' above).  These are added ``per class'' of
  ClassAd, however.  The classes refer to the ``type'' of ClassAds
  (i.e. ``Start'').  Additionally, there is a ``Total'' class created
  which represents the history of all ClassAds that this Collector
  receives.

  Note that the collector always publishes Lost, Total and Sequenced
  counts for all ClassAd ``classes''.  This is similar to the
  statistics gathered if \MacroU{COLLECTOR\_DAEMON\_STATS} is enabled.

 \item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_QUERY\_WORKERS}]
  \label{param:CollectorQueryWorkers} This macro sets the maximum
  number of ``worker'' processes that the Collector can have.  When
  receiving a query request, the UNIX Collector will ``fork'' a new
  process to handle the query, freeing the main process to handle
  other requests.  When the number of outstanding ``worker'' processes
  reaches this maximum, the request is handled by the main process.
  This macro is ignored on Windows, and it's default value is zero.

\item[\Macro{COLLECTOR\_DEBUG}] \label{param:CollectorDebug} This
  macro (and other macros related to debug logging in the collector)
  is described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
  \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\index{configuration!condor\_negotiator configuration variables}

These macros affect the \Condor{negotiator}.
\begin{description}
  
\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_INTERVAL}] \label{param:NegotiatorInterval}
  Sets how often the negotiator starts a negotiation cycle.  It is defined
  in seconds and defaults to 300 (5 minutes).
  
\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CYCLE\_DELAY}] \label{param:NegotiatorCycleDelay}
  An integer value that represents the minimum number of seconds
  that must pass before a new negotiation cycle may start.
  The default value is 20.
  \MacroNI{NEGOTIATOR\_CYCLE\_DELAY} is intended only for use by
  Condor experts.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:NegotiatorTimeout}
  Sets the timeout that the negotiator uses on its network connections
  to the schedds and startds.  It is defined in seconds and defaults to 30.
  
\item[\Macro{PRIORITY\_HALFLIFE}] \label{param:PriorityHalfLife} This
  macro defines the half-life of the user priorities.  See
  section~\ref{sec:user-priority-explained}
  on User Priorities for details.  It is defined in seconds and defaults
  to 86400 (1 day).

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_PRIO\_FACTOR}] \label{param:DefaultPrioFactor} 
  This macro sets the priority factor for local users. See
  section~\ref{sec:user-priority-explained}
  on User Priorities for details.  Defaults to 1.

\item[\Macro{NICE\_USER\_PRIO\_FACTOR}] \label{param:NiceUserPrioFactor} 
  This macro sets the priority factor for nice users. See
  section~\ref{sec:user-priority-explained}
  on User Priorities for details.  Defaults to 10000000.

\item[\Macro{REMOTE\_PRIO\_FACTOR}] \label{param:RemotePrioFactor} 
  This macro defines the priority factor for remote users (users who
  who do not belong to the accountant's local domain - see
  below). See section~\ref{sec:user-priority-explained}
  on User Priorities for details.  Defaults to 10000.

\item[\Macro{ACCOUNTANT\_LOCAL\_DOMAIN}] \label{param:AccountantLocalDomain} 
  This macro is used to decide if a user is local or remote. A user
  is considered to be in the local domain if the UID\_DOMAIN matches
  the value of this macro. Usually, this macro is set
  to the local UID\_DOMAIN. If it is not defined, all users are considered
  local.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_ACCOUNTANT\_DATABASE\_SIZE}] 
  \label{param:MaxAccountantDatabaseSize}
  This macro defines the maximum size (in bytes) that the accountant
  database log file can reach before it is truncated (which re-writes
  the file in a more compact format).
  If, after truncating, the file is larger than one half the maximum
  size specified with this macro, the maximum size will be
  automatically expanded.
  The default is 1 megabyte (1000000).

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_DISCOUNT\_SUSPENDED\_RESOURCES}] \label{param:NegotiatorDiscountSuspendedResources} 
   This macro tells the negotiator to not count resources that are suspended
   when calculating the number of resources a user is using. 
   Defaults to false, that is, a user is still charged for a resource even
   when that resource has suspended the job.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_SOCKET\_CACHE\_SIZE}]
  \label{param:NegotiatorSocketCacheSize} This macro defines the
  maximum number of sockets that the negotiator keeps in its
  open socket cache.  Caching open sockets makes the negotiation
  protocol more efficient by eliminating the need for socket
  connection establishment for each negotiation cycle.  The default is
  currently 16.  To be effective, this parameter should be set to a
  value greater than the number of schedds submitting jobs to the
  negotiator at any time.  If you lower this number, you must run
  \Condor{restart} and not just \Condor{reconfig} for the change to
  take effect.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_PRE\_JOB\_RANK}]
  \label{param:NegotiatorPreJobRank} Resources that match a request
  are first sorted by this expression, then by the user-supplied rank
  in the job ClassAd, then by \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK}, then by
  \Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK} (if the match would cause preemption).  The purpose
  of the pre job rank is to allow the pool administrator to override any
  other rankings, in order to optimize overall throughput.  For example,
  it is generally used to prevent preemption when possible, even if the job
  rank prefers a machine that is busy.
  The default value is undefined, which causes this rank
  to have no effect on the ranking of matches.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK}]
  \label{param:NegotiatorPostJobRank} Resources that match a request
  are first sorted by the \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_PRE\_JOB\_RANK}
  expression, then by the user-supplied rank in the job ClassAd, then
  by \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK}, then by
  \Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK} (if the match would cause preemption).  The
  purpose of the post job rank is to allow the pool administrator to
  choose between machines that the job ranks equally.  For example,
  you might want breadth-first instead of depth-first filling of a
  cluster of multi-processor machines.
  The default value is undefined, which causes this rank
  to have no effect on the ranking of matches.

\item[\Macro{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS}]
  \label{param:PreemptionRequirements} The negotiator will not preempt
  a job running on a given machine unless the
  \MacroNI{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS} expression evaluates to TRUE and the
  owner of the idle job has a better priority than the owner of the
  running job.  By default, this expression allows jobs to be
  preempted only after they have run for one hour, and only if the
  priority of the competing user is 20\% higher, in order to prevent
  ``churning'' of jobs in the pool.

\item[\Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK}] \label{param:PreemptionRank}
  Resources that match a request are first sorted by the
  \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK} expression, then by the
  user-supplied rank in the job ClassAd, then by
  \Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_POST\_JOB\_RANK}, then by
  \Macro{PREEMPTION\_RANK} (if the match would cause preemption).
  This expression is used to rank machines that the job and the other
  negotiation expressions rank the same.  For example, if the job has
  no preference, it is usually preferable to preempt a job with a
  small \AdAttr{ImageSize} instead of a job with a large
  \AdAttr{ImageSize}.  The default is to rank all preemptable matches
  the same.  However, the negotiator will always prefer to match the
  job with an idle machine over a preemptable machine, if none of the
  other ranks express a preference between them.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_DEBUG}] \label{param:NegotiatorDebug} This macro
  (and other settings related to debug logging in the negotiator) is
  described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_MAX\_TIME\_PER\_SUBMITTER}] \label{param:NegotiatorMaxTimePerSubmitter} This macro limits the amount of time the negotiator will 
spend with a submitter. It defaults to one year.

\end{description}
The following configuration macros affect negotiation for 
group users.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{GROUP\_NAMES}] \label{param:GroupNames}
  A comma-separated list of the recognized group names, case insensitive.
  If undefined (the default), group support is disabled.
  Group names must not conflict with any user names.
  That is, if there is a \verb@physics@ group, there may not be
  a \verb@physics@ user.
  Any group that is defined here must also have a quota,
  or the group will be ignored. Example: 
  \begin{verbatim}
    GROUP_NAMES = group_physics, group_chemistry 
  \end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GROUP\_QUOTA\_<groupname>}] \label{param:GroupQuotaGroupname}
  A positive integer  to represent a static quota specifing
  the exact number of machines owned by this group.
  Note that Condor does not verify or check consistency of quota values.
  % When both are defined, static quotas supersede dynamic quotas. 
  Example:
  \begin{verbatim}
    GROUP_QUOTA_group_physics = 20
    GROUP_QUOTA_group_chemistry = 10
  \end{verbatim}

%\item[\Macro{GROUP\_DYNAMIC\_MACH\_CONSTRAINT}] \label{param:GroupDynamicMachConstraint}
%  Filter the number of machines for use with dynamic groups accounting
%  quotas, below.  Without this filter, dynamic quotas are calculated
%  from the total of all machines, in all states, that have reported to
%  the collector, which is probably not what you want.  Use this filter to
%  restrict the number of machines reserved for calculating dynamic
%  quotas.  The value is a ClassAd expression, and is evaluated every
%  negotiation cycle.  For example, the following expression will only
%  consider unclaimed Intel/Linux machines for dynamic quotas.
%
%  \begin{verbatim}
%    GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT = State == "Unclaimed" && \
%    Arch == "INTEL" && OpSys == "LINUX"
%  \end{verbatim}
%  will only considered. If all computers should be considered for
%  dynamic quotas, then the following expression could be used:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%      GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT = TRUE
%  \end{verbatim}


%\item[\Macro{GROUP\_QUOTA\_DYNAMIC\_<groupname>}] \label{param:GroupQuotaDynamicGroupname}
%  Specify a dynamic group accounting quota.  For example, the following
%  specifies that a quota of 25\% of the total dynamic quota machines are
%  reserved for members of the group\_biology group.
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  	GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_biology = 0.25
%  \end{verbatim}
%  The total dynamic quota machine count is determined using
%  \Macro{GROUP\_DYNAMIC\_MACH\_CONSTRAINT above}. The group name must
%  also be specified in the \Macro{GROUP\_NAMES} list. The value must be
%  positive float between 0.0 and 1.0. Condor does not verify that the
%  quota value is reasonable, nor does Condor verify that all specified
%  quotas are consistent.  This parameter is evaluated whenever Condor
%  negotiates for the group.  When both are defined, static quotas
%  supersede dynamic quotas.

\item[\Macro{GROUP\_PRIO\_FACTOR\_<groupname>}] \label{param:GroupPrioFactorGroupname}
  A floating point value greater than or equal to 1.0 to specify the
  default user priority factor for \verb@<groupname>@. 
  The group name must also be specified in the \MacroNI{GROUP\_NAMES} list.
  \MacroNI{GROUP\_PRIO\_FACTOR\_<groupname>} is evaluated when
  the negotiator first negotiates for the user as a member of the group.
  All members of the group inherit the default priority factor.
  For example, the following setting
  specifies that all member of the group named \verb@group_physics@
  inherit a default user priority factor of 2.0:
  \begin{verbatim}
    GROUP_PRIO_FACTOR_group_physics = 2.0
  \end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP}] \label{param:GroupAutoregroup}
  A boolean value (defaults to \Expr{False}) that when \Expr{True},
  causes users who submitted to a specific group to
  also negotiate a second time with the \verb@none@ group,
  to be considered with the independent job submitters. 
  This allows group submitted jobs to be matched with idle machines
  even if the group is over its quota.

\item[\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION}] \label{param:NegotiatorConsiderPreemption}
  For expert users only. A boolean value (defaults to \Expr{True}),
  that when \Expr{False},
  can cause the negotiator to run
  faster and also have better spinning pie accuracy.
  \emph{Only set this to \Expr{False} if \Macro{PREEMPTION\_REQUIREMENTS}
  is \Expr{False},
  and if all \condor{startd} rank expressions are \Expr{False}.}

These macros affect the \Condor{gridmanager}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_LOG}]
\label{param:GridmanagerLog} Logs for the \Condor{gridmanager} 
  will be written as the user who submitted the individual jobs.
  As a result \MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_LOG} should defined to incorporate
  \MacroUNI{USERNAME} to specify a different file for each user
  in a directory that users will be able to write into.
  An example definition:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  GRIDMANAGER_LOG = /tmp/GridmanagerLog.$(USERNAME)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_CHECKPROXY\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:GridmanagerCheckproxyInterval} The number of seconds
between checks for an updated X509 proxy credential. The default
is 10 minutes (600 seconds).

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MINIMUM\_PROXY\_TIME}]
\label{param:GridmanagerMinimumProxyTime} The minimum number of
seconds before expiration of the X509 proxy credential for the
gridmanager to continue operation. If seconds until expiration is
less than this number, the gridmanager will shutdown and wait for
a refreshed proxy credential. The default is 3 minutes (180 seconds).

\item[\Macro{HOLD\_JOB\_IF\_CREDENTIAL\_EXPIRES}]
\label{param:HoldJobIfCredentialExpires} True or False.
Defaults to True.
If True, and for globus universe jobs only,
Condor-G will place a job on hold
\MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_MINIMUM\_PROXY\_TIME} seconds
before the proxy expires.
If False,
the job will stay in the last known state,
and Condor-G will periodically check to see if the job's proxy has been
refreshed, at which point management of the job will resume.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_CONTACT\_SCHEDD\_DELAY}]
\label{param:GridmanagerContactScheddDelay} The minimum number of
seconds between connections to the schedd. The default is 5 seconds.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:GridmanagerJobProbeInterval}
After a job is submitted, how often (in seconds) the \Condor{gridmanager}
should probe the remote jobmanager to ensure it is still alive and well.

\item[\Macro{CONDOR\_JOB\_POLL\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:CondorJobPollInterval}
After a condor grid type job is submitted, how often (in seconds) the \Condor{gridmanager}
should probe the remote schedd to check the jobs status.  
This defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
Setting this to a lower number will decrease latency (Condor will discover
that a job has finished more quickly), but will increase network traffic.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_DELAY}]
\label{param:GridmanagerJobProbeDelay} The number of seconds between
active probes of the status of a submitted job. The default is 5
minutes (300 seconds).

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_RESOURCE\_PROBE\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:GridmanagerResourceProbeInterval}
When a resource appears to be down, how often (in seconds) the
\Condor{gridmanager}
should ping it to test if it is up again.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_RESOURCE\_PROBE\_DELAY}]
\label{param:GridmanagerResourceProbeDelay} The number of seconds
between pings of a remote resource that is currently down. The default
is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_SUBMITTED\_JOBS\_PER\_RESOURCE}]
\label{param:GridmanagerMaxSubmittedJobsPerResource}
Limits the number of jobs
that a \Condor{gridmanager} daemon will submit to a resource.
It is useful for controlling the number of \Prog{jobmanager}
processes running on the front-end node of a cluster.
This number may be exceeded if it is reduced through the use
of \Condor{reconfig} while the \Condor{gridmanager} is running
or if the \Condor{gridmanager} receives new
jobs from the \Condor{schedd} that were already submitted
(that is, their \MacroNI{GlobusContactString} is not "X").
In these cases, submitted jobs will not be killed,
but no new jobs can be submitted until the number of submitted
jobs falls below the current limit.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_PENDING\_SUBMITS\_PER\_RESOURCE}]
\label{param:GridmanagerMaxPendingSubmitsPerResource} The maximum
number of jobs
that can be in the process of being submitted at any time (that is,
how many \Procedure{globus\_gram\_client\_job\_request} calls are pending).
It is useful for controlling the number of new
connections/processes created at a given time.
The default value is 5.
This variable allows
you to set different limits for each resource.
After the first integer in the value
comes a list of resourcename/number pairs,
where each number is the limit for that resource.
If a resource is not in the list,
Condor uses the first integer.
An example usage:
\begin{verbatim}
GRIDMANAGER_MAX_PENDING_SUBMITS_PER_RESOURCE=20,nostos,5,beak,50
\end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_PENDING\_SUBMITS}]
\label{param:GridmanagerMaxPendingSubmits} Configuration variable
still recognized, but the name has changed to be
\MacroNI{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_PENDING\_SUBMITS\_PER\_RESOURCE}.

\item[\Macro{GAHP}]
\label{param:Gahp} The full path to the binary of the GAHP server.

\item[\Macro{GAHP\_ARGS}]
\label{param:GahpArgs} Arguments to be passed to the GAHP server.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_GAHP\_CALL\_TIMEOUT}]
\label{param:GridmanagerGahpCallTimeout} The number of seconds after
which a pending GAHP command should time out. The default is 5 minutes
(300 seconds).

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_PENDING\_REQUESTS}]
\label{param:GridmanagerMaxPendingRequests} The maximum number of GAHP
commands that can be pending at any time. The default is 50.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_CONNECT\_FAILURE\_RETRY\_COUNT}]
\label{param:GridmanagerConnectFailureRetryCount} The number of times
to retry a command that failed due to a timeout or a failed connection.
The default is 3.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_SYNC\_JOB\_IO\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:GridmanagerSyncJobIoInterval} The number of seconds between
periodic syncs of streamed output to disk. The default is 5 minutes
(300 seconds).

\item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_GLOBUS\_COMMIT\_TIMEOUT}]
\label{param:GridmanagerGlobusCommitTimeout}  The duration, in seconds, of the
two phase commit timeout to Globus.  This maps directly to the \texttt{two\_phase} setting in the Globus RSL.

% \item[\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_RESTART\_ON\_ANY\_DOWN\_RESOURCES}]
% \label{param:GridmanagerRestartOnAnyDownResources} 
% The current GAHP server can transition into a state where it
% cannot contact remote machines,
% making the machines appear to be down.
% Restarting the GAHP server fixes the problem.
% This parameter controls whether one machine or

%Related to GRIDMANAGER\_RESTART\_ON\_ANY\_DOWN\_RESOURCES,
%this configuration variable defines how long (in seconds) one or
%more machines need to be down (or just appear to be) to trigger a restart
%of the GAHP server.

\item[\Macro{GLOBUS\_GATEKEEPER\_TIMEOUT}]
\label{param:GlobusGatekeeperTimeout} The number of seconds after
which if a globus
universe job fails to ping the gatekeeper,
the job will be put on hold.
Defaults to 5 days (in seconds).

These macros affect the \Prog{grid\_monitor}.
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{ENABLE\_GRID\_MONITOR}] \label{param:EnableGridMonitor}
  When set to \Expr{True} enables the \Prog{grid\_monitor} tool.  The
  \Prog{grid\_monitor} tool is used to reduce load on Globus gatekeepers.
  This parameter only affects globus universe jobs.
  \MacroNI{GRID\_MONITOR} must also be correctly configured.
  Defaults to \Expr{False}.
  See section~\ref{sec:Condor-G-GridMonitor} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Condor-G-GridMonitor}
  for more information.

\item[\Macro{GRID\_MONITOR}] \label{param:GridMonitor}
  The complete pathname of the \Prog{grid\_monitor} tool used to reduce load on
  Globus gatekeepers.  This parameter only affects globus
  universe jobs.  This parameter is not referenced unless
  \MacroNI{ENABLE\_GRID\_MONITOR} is set to \Expr{True}. 
  See section~\ref{sec:Condor-G-GridMonitor} on
  page~\pageref{sec:Condor-G-GridMonitor}
  for more information.

\item[\Macro{GRID\_MONITOR\_HEARTBEAT\_TIMEOUT}] \label{param:GridMonitorHeartbeatTimeout}
  If this many seconds pass without hearing from a \Prog{grid\_monitor}, it is
  assumed to be dead.  Defaults to 300 (5 minutes).  Increasing this number
  will improve the ability of the \Prog{grid\_monitor} to survive in the face of
  transient problems but will also increase the time before Condor notices a
  problem.

\item[\Macro{GRID\_MONITOR\_RETRY\_DURATION}] \label{param:GridMonitorRetryDuration}
  If something goes wrong with the \Prog{grid\_monitor} at a particular site
  (like \MacroNI{GRID\_MONITOR\_HEARTBEAT\_TIMEOUT} expiring), Condor-G will
  attempt to restart the \Prog{grid\_monitor} for this many seconds.  Defaults
  to 900 (15 minutes).  If this duration passes without success the
  \Prog{grid\_monitor} will be disabled for the site in question until 60
  minutes have passed.

\subsection{\label{sec:DAGMan-Config-File-Entries}
Configuration File Entries for DAGMan}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!DAGMan configuration variables}
These macros affect the operation of DAGMan and DAGMan
jobs within Condor.

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_MAX\_SUBMITS\_PER\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:DAGManMaxSubmitsPerInterval}
An integer that controls how many individual jobs
\Condor{dagman} will submit in a row
before servicing other requests (such as a \Condor{rm}).
The legal range of values is 1 to 1000.
If defined with a value less than 1, the  value 1 will be used.
If defined with a value greater than 1000, the value 1000 will be used.
If undefined, it defaults to 5.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_MAX\_SUBMIT\_ATTEMPTS}]
\label{param:DAGManMaxSubmitAttempts}
An integer that controls how
many times in a row \Condor{dagman} will attempt to execute
\Condor{submit} for a given job before giving up.
Note that consecutive attempts use an exponential backoff,
starting with 1 second.
The legal range of values is 1 to 16.
If defined with a value less than 1, the  value 1 will be used.
If defined with a value greater than 16, the value 16 will be used.
Note that a value of 16 would result in \Condor{dagman} trying for
approximately 36 hours before giving up.
If left undefined,
it defaults to 6 (approximately two minutes before giving up).

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_SUBMIT\_DELAY}]
\label{param:DAGManSubmitDelay}
An integer that controls the number of seconds
that \Condor{dagman} will sleep before submitting consecutive jobs.
It can be increased to help reduce the load on the \Condor{schedd} daemon.
The legal range of values is 0 to 60.
If defined with a value less than 0, the  value 0 will be used.
If defined with a value greater than 60, the value 60 will be used.
The default value is 0.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_STARTUP\_CYCLE\_DETECT}]
\label{param:DAGManStartupCycleDetect}
A boolean value that when \Expr{True}
causes \Condor{dagman} to check for cycles in the DAG before
submitting DAG node jobs,
in addition to its run time cycle detection.
If undefined, it defaults to \Expr{False}.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_RETRY\_SUBMIT\_FIRST}]
\label{param:DAGManRetrySubmitFirst}
A boolean value that controls whether a failed submit is retried first
(before any other submits) or last (after all other ready jobs are
submitted).  If this value is set to \Expr{True}, when a job submit
fails, the job is placed at the head of the queue of ready jobs, so
that it will be submitted again before any other jobs are submitted
(this has been the behavior of \Condor{dagman} up to this point).
If this value is set to \Expr{False}, when a job submit fails, the job
is placed at the tail of the queue of ready jobs.
If undefined, it defaults to \Expr{True}.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_MAX\_JOBS\_IDLE}]
\label{param:DAGManMaxJobsIdle}
An integer value that controls the maximum number of idle node jobs
allowed within the DAG before \Condor{dagman} temporarily stops
submitting jobs.  Once idle jobs start to run, \Condor{dagman} will
resume submitting jobs.  If both the command-line flag and the
configuration parameter are specified, the command-line flag overrides
the configuration parameter.  The default is that there is no limit
on the maximum number of idle jobs.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_MAX\_JOBS\_SUBMITTED}]
\label{param:DAGManMaxJobsSubmitted}
An integer value that controls the maximum number of node jobs within the
DAG that will  be submitted to Condor at one time.  Note that this
parameter is the same as the \OptArg{-maxjobs} command-line flag
to condor\_submit\_dag.  If both the command-line flag and the
configuration parameter are specified, the command-line flag overrides
the configuration parameter.  The default is that there is no limit
on the maximum number of jobs run at one time.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_MUNGE\_NODE\_NAMES}]
\label{param:DAGManMungeNodeNames}
A boolean value that controls whether \Condor{dagman} automatically
renames nodes when running multiple DAGs (the renaming is done to
avoid possible name conflicts).  If this value is set to \Expr{True},
all node names have the "DAG number" prepended to them.  For example,
the first DAG specified on the condor\_submit\_dag command line is
considered DAG number 0, the second is DAG number 1, etc.  So if
DAG number 2 has a node B, that node will internally be renamed
to "2.B".
If undefined, \Macro{DAGMAN\_MUNGE\_NODE\_NAMES} defaults to \Expr{True}.

% \item[\Macro{STORK\_SERVER}]
% \label{param:StorkServer}

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_IGNORE\_DUPLICATE\_JOB\_EXECUTION}]
\label{param:DAGManIgnoreDuplicateJobExecution}
A boolean value that controls
whether \Condor{dagman} aborts or continues with a DAG
in the rare case that Condor erroneously executes
the job within a DAG node more than once.
A bug in Condor very occasionally causes a job to run twice.
Running a job twice is contrary to the semantics of a DAG.
The configuration macro \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_IGNORE\_DUPLICATE\_JOB\_EXECUTION}
determines whether  \Condor{dagman} considers this a fatal error or not.
The default value is \Expr{False}; \Condor{dagman} considers
running the job more than once a fatal error, 
logs this fact,
and aborts the DAG.
When set to \Expr{True}, \Condor{dagman} still
logs this fact,
but continues with the DAG. 

This configuration macro is to remain at its default value 
except in the case
where a site encounters the Condor bug in which DAG job nodes
are executed twice,
and where it is certain
that having a DAG job node run twice will not corrupt the DAG.
The logged messages within \File{*.dagman.out} files
in the case of that a node job runs twice
contain the string
"EVENT ERROR."

This macro is now deprecated (because of the improved functionality
of the \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALLOW\_EVENTS} macro).

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALLOW\_EVENTS}]
\label{param:DAGManAllowEvents}
An integer that controls which "bad" events are considered
fatal errors by \Condor{dagman}.  This macro replaces and expands
upon the functionality of the
\MacroNI{DAGMAN\_IGNORE\_DUPLICATE\_JOB\_EXECUTION} macro.
If \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALLOW\_EVENTS} is set, it overrides the
setting of \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_IGNORE\_DUPLICATE\_JOB\_EXECUTION}.

The \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALLOW\_EVENTS} value is a bitwise-OR of the
following values:
\begin{description}
\item 0 = allow no "bad" events
\item 1 = allow all "bad" events (overrides other bits)
\item 2 = allow terminated/aborted event combination
\item 4 = allow "job re-run after terminated event" bug
\item 8 = allow garbage/orphan events
\item 16 = allow execute event before job's submit event
\item 32 = allow two terminated events per job (sometimes seen
with grid jobs)
\end{description}

The default value is 50 (allow terminated/aborted event combination,
allow execute event before job's submit event, and allow double terminated
events).

For example, a value of 6 instructs \Condor{dagman} to allow both
the terminated/aborted event combination and the "job re-run
after terminated event" bug.  A value of 0 means that any "bad"
event will be considered a fatal error.

This macro should almost always remain set to the default value!

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_DEBUG}] \label{param:DAGManDebug} This macro
is described in section~\ref{param:SubsysDebug} as
\Macro{SUBSYS\_DEBUG}.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_CONDOR\_SUBMIT\_EXE}]
\label{param:DAGManCondorSubmitExe}
The executable that \Condor{dagman} will use to submit Condor jobs.
If undefined, \Condor{dagman} looks for \Condor{submit} in the PATH.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_STORK\_SUBMIT\_EXE}]
\label{param:DAGManStorkSubmitExe}
The executable that \Condor{dagman} will use to submit Stork jobs.
If undefined, \Condor{dagman} looks for \Stork{submit} in the PATH.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_CONDOR\_RM\_EXE}]
\label{param:DAGManCondorRmExe}
The executable that \Condor{dagman} will use to remove Condor jobs.
If undefined, \Condor{dagman} looks for \Condor{rm} in the PATH.

\item[\Macro{DAGMAN\_STORK\_RM\_EXE}]
\label{param:DAGManStorkRmExe}
The executable that \Condor{dagman} will use to remove Stork jobs.
If undefined, \Condor{dagman} looks for \Stork{rm} in the PATH.

Configuration File Entries Relating to Security}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!security configuration variables}
These macros affect the secure operation of Condor.
Many of these macros are described in
section~\ref{sec:Security} on Security.

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{SEC\_*\_AUTHENTICATION}]
\label{param:SecAuthentication} \Todo

\item[\Macro{SEC\_*\_ENCRYPTION}]
\label{param:SecEncryption} \Todo

\item[\Macro{SEC\_*\_INTEGRITY}]
\label{param:SecIntegrity} \Todo

\item[\Macro{SEC\_*\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS}]
\label{param:SecAuthenticationMethods} \Todo

\item[\Macro{SEC\_*\_CRYPTO\_METHODS}]
\label{param:SecCryptoMethods} \Todo

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonName} A comma separated list of the subject
name(s) of the certificate(s) that the daemons use.

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonDirectory} A directory name used in the
construction of complete paths for the configuration variables
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_CERT},
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_KEY}, and
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_TRUSTED\_CA\_DIR},
for any of these configuration variables are not explicitly set.

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_CERT}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonCert} A complete path and file name to the
X.509 certificate to be used in GSI authentication.
If this configuration variable is not defined, and
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is defined, then Condor uses
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} to construct the path and file name as
\begin{verbatim}
GSI_DAEMON_CERT  = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIRECTORY)/hostcert.pem
\end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_KEY}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonKey}  A complete path and file name to the
X.509 private key to be used in GSI authentication.
If this configuration variable is not defined, and
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is defined, then Condor uses
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} to construct the path and file name as
\begin{verbatim}
GSI_DAEMON_KEY  = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIRECTORY)/hostkey.pem
\end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_TRUSTED\_CA\_DIR}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonTrustedCADir} The directory that contains the
list of trusted certification authorities to be used in GSI authentication.
The files in this directory are the public keys and signing policies
of the trusted certification authorities.
If this configuration variable is not defined, and
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} is defined, then Condor uses
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_DIRECTORY} to construct the directory path as
\begin{verbatim}
GSI_DAEMON_TRUSTED_CA_DIR  = $(GSI_DAEMON_DIRECTORY)/certificates
\end{verbatim}

\item[\Macro{GSI\_DAEMON\_PROXY}]
\label{param:GSIDaemonProxy} A complete path and file name to the
X.509 proxy to be used in GSI authentication.
When this configuration variable is defined, use of this proxy
takes precedence over use of a certificate and key.

\item[\Macro{GRIDMAP}]
\label{param:GridMap}
The complete path and file name of the Globus Gridmap file.
The Gridmap file is used to map
X.509 distinguished names to Condor user ids.

\item[\Macro{SEC\_DEFAULT\_SESSION\_DURATION}]
\label{param:SessionDuration} The amount of time in seconds before
a communication session expires.
%Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
Defaults to 8640000 seconds (100 days) to avoid a bug in session
renegotiation for Condor Version 6.6.0.
A session is a record of necessary information to do communication
between a client and daemon, and is protected by a shared secret key.
The session expires to reduce the window of opportunity where
the key may be compromised by attack.

\item[\Macro{FS\_REMOTE\_DIR}]
\label{param:FSRemoteDir}
The location of a file visible to both server and client in
Remote File System authentication.
The default when not defined is the directory 
\File{/shared/scratch/tmp}.

\item[\Macro{ENCRYPT\_EXECUTE\_DIRECTORY}]
\label{param:EncryptExecuteDirectory}
The execute directory for jobs on Windows platforms may be
encrypted by setting this configuration variable to \Expr{True}.
Defaults to \Expr{False}.
The method of encryption uses the EFS (Encrypted File System)
feature of Windows NTFS v5.

\item[\Macro{SEC\_TCP\_SESSION\_TIMEOUT}]
\label{param:SecTCPSessionTimeout}
The length of time in seconds until the timeout
when establishing a UDP security session via TCP.
The default value is 20 seconds.
Scalability issues with a large pool would be the only basis
for a change from the default value.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sec:HA-Config-File-Entries}
Configuration File Entries Relating to High Availability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{configuration!high availability configuration variables}
These macros affect the high availability operation of Condor.

\begin{description}
\item[\Macro{MASTER\_HA\_LIST}] \label{param:MasterHAList} Similar to
  \Macro{DAEMON\_LIST}, this macro defines a list of daemons that
  the \Condor{master} starts and keeps its watchful eyes on.
  However, the \MacroNI{MASTER\_HA\_LIST} daemons are run in a
  \emph{High Availability} mode.
  The list is a comma or space separated list of subsystem names
  (as listed in section~\ref{sec:Condor-Subsystem-Names}).
  For example,
  \begin{verbatim}
        MASTER_HA_LIST = SCHEDD
  \end{verbatim}

  The \emph{High Availability} feature allows for several \Condor{master}
  daemons (most likely on separate machines) to work together to
  insure that a particular service stays available.  These
  \Condor{master} daemons ensure that one and only one of them will
  have the listed daemons running.

  To use this feature, the lock URL must be set with
  \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_URL}.

  Currently, only file URLs are supported 
  (those with \File{file:\Dots}).
  The default value for \MacroNI{MASTER\_HA\_LIST} is 
  the empty string, which disables the feature.
  
\item[\Macro{HA\_LOCK\_URL}] \label{param:HALockURL} This macro
  specifies the URL that the \Condor{master} processes use to
  syncronize for the \emph{High Availability} service.
  Currently, only file URLs are supported; for example,
  \File{file:/share/spool}.  Note that this URL must be identical
  for all \Condor{master} processes sharing this resource.  For
  \Condor{schedd} sharing, we recommend setting up \MacroNI{SPOOL}
  on an NFS share and having all \emph{High Availability}
  \Condor{schedd} processes sharing it,
  and setting the \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_URL} to point at this directory
  as well.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
        MASTER_HA_LIST = SCHEDD
        SPOOL = /share/spool
        HA_LOCK_URL = file:/share/spool
\end{verbatim}

  A separate lock is created for each \emph{High Availability} daemon.

  There is no default value for \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_URL}.

\item[\Macro{HA\_daemon\_LOCK\_URL}]
  \label{param:HAdaemonLockURL} This macro controls the 
  \emph{High Availability} lock URL for a specific \Expr{daemon}
  as specified in the configuration variable name,
  and it overrides the system-wide lock URL specified by
  \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_URL}.  If not defined for each daemon,
  \MacroNI{HA\_daemon\_LOCK\_URL} is ignored, and the value of
  \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_URL} is used.

\item[\Macro{HA\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME}] \label{param:HALockHoldTime}
  This macro
  specifies the number of seconds that the \Condor{master} will hold the
  lock for each \emph{High Availability} daemon.
  Upon gaining the shared lock,
  the \Condor{master} will hold the lock for this number of seconds.
  Additionally, the \Condor{master} will periodically renew
  each lock as long as the \Condor{master} and the daemon is running.
  When the daemon dies, or the \Condor{master} exists, the
  \Condor{master} will immediately release the lock(s) it holds.

  \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME} defaults to 3600 seconds (one hour).

\item[\Macro{HA\_daemon\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME}]
  \label{param:HAdaemonLockHoldTime}
  This macro controls the \emph{High Availability} lock
  hold time for a specific \Expr{daemon}
  as specified in the configuration variable name,
  and it overrides the system wide poll period specified by
  \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME}.
  If not defined for each daemon,
  \MacroNI{HA\_daemon\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME} is ignored,
  and the value of \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME} is used.

\item[\Macro{HA\_POLL\_PERIOD}] \label{param:HALockPollPeriod} 
  This macro specifies how often the \Condor{master} polls the
  \emph{High Availability} locks to see if any locks are either stale
  (meaning not updated for \MacroNI{HA\_LOCK\_HOLD\_TIME} seconds),
  or have been released by the owning \Condor{master}.
  Additionally, the \Condor{master} renews any locks that it
  holds during these polls.

  \MacroNI{HA\_POLL\_PERIOD} defaults to 300 seconds (five minutes).

\item[\Macro{HA\_daemon\_POLL\_PERIOD}]
  \label{param:HALockPolldaemonPeriod}
  This macro controls the \emph{High Availability} pool period
  for a specific \Expr{daemon}
  as specified in the configuration variable name,
  and it overrides the system wide poll period specified by
  \MacroNI{HA\_POLL\_PERIOD}.
  If not defined for each daemon,
  \MacroNI{HA\_daemon\_POLL\_PERIOD} is ignored,
  and the value of \MacroNI{HA\_POLL\_PERIOD} is used.


\item[\Macro{HAD\_LIST}]
  \label{param:HADList}
  A comma-separated list of all \Condor{had} daemons
  in the form \Expr{IP:port} or \Expr{hostname:port}.
  Each central manager machine that runs the \Condor{had} daemon
  should appear in this list.
  If \MacroNI{HAD\_USE\_PRIMARY} is set to \Expr{True},
  then the first machine in this list is the primary central
  manager, and all others in the list are backups.

  All central manager machines must be configured with 
  an identical \MacroNI{HAD\_LIST}.
  The machine addresses are identical to the addresses defined
  in \MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST}.

%The following examples are all valid HAD\_LIST declarations: 
%
%HAD\_LIST =<132.68.37.104:10001>,<132.68.37.105:10002>,<132.68.37.106:1045>
%
%HAD\_LIST =132.68.37.104:10001,132.68.37.105:10002,132.68.37.106:1045
%
%HAD\_LIST=ds-r3.cs.technion.ac.il:10001,ds-r3.cs.technion.ac.il:10002,ds-r3.cs.technion.ac.il:1045
%


\item[\Macro{HAD\_USE\_PRIMARY}]
  \label{param:HADUsePrimary}
  Boolean value to determine if the first machine in the 
  \MacroNI{HAD\_LIST} configuration variable is
  a primary central manager.
  Defaults to \Expr{False}.


\item[\Macro{HAD\_CONNECTION\_TIMEOUT}]
  \label{param:HADConnectionTimeout}
  The time (in seconds) that the \Condor{had} daemon waits before giving
  up on the establishment of a TCP connection.
  The failure of the communication connection
  is the detection mechanism for the failure of a central
  manager machine.
  For a LAN, a recommended value is 2 seconds.
  The use of authentication (by Condor) increases the connection
  time.
  The default value is 5 seconds.
  If this value is set too low,
  \Condor{had} daemons will incorrectly assume
  the failure of other machines.

\item[\Macro{HAD\_ARGS}]
  \label{param:HADArgs}
  Command line arguments passed by the \Condor{master} daemon
  as it invokes the \Condor{had} daemon.
  To make high availability work, the \Condor{had} daemon
  requires the port number it is to use.
  This argument is of the form
  \begin{verbatim}
   -p $(HAD_PORT_NUMBER)
  \end{verbatim}
  where \MacroNI{HAD\_PORT\_NUMBER} is defined with the
  desired port number.
  Note that this port number must be the same value here as
  used in \MacroNI{HAD\_LIST}.
  There is no default value.


\item[\Macro{HAD}]
  \label{param:HAD}
  The path to the \Condor{had} executable. Normally it is defined
  relative to \MacroUNI{SBIN}.
  This configuration variable has no default value.

\item[\Macro{MAX\_HAD\_LOG}]
  \label{param:MaxHADLog}
  Controls the maximum length in bytes to which the \Condor{had}
  daemon log will be allowed to grow. It will grow to the specified length,
  then be saved to a file with the suffix \File{.old}. 
  The \File{.old}  file is overwritten each time the log is saved,
  thus the maximum space devoted to logging is twice the maximum length
  of this log file.
  A value of 0 specifies that this file may grow without bounds.
  The default is 1 Mbyte.

\item[\Macro{HAD\_DEBUG}]
  \label{param:HADDebug}
  Logging level for the \Condor{had} daemon.
  See \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_DEBUG} for values.

\item[\Macro{HAD\_LOG}]
  \label{param:HADLog}
  Path to the log file.

Condor-G and \Condor{credd} will have the capability to autonomously
refresh proxy certificates.  By default, this macro is undefined.

% Configuration File Macros affecting APIs}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% \begin{description}
% 
% \item[\Macro{ENABLE\_SOAP}]
%   \label{param:EnableSoap}
%   A boolean value that defaults to \Expr{False}.
%   When \Expr{True}, Condor daemons will respond to HTTP PUT commands
%   as if they were SOAP calls. When \Expr{False},
%   all HTTP PUT commands are denied.
% 
% \item[\Macro{ENABLE\_WEB\_SERVER}]
%   \label{param:EnableWebServer}
%   A boolean value that defaults to \Expr{False}.
%   When \Expr{True}, Condor daemons will respond to HTTP GET commands,
%   and send the static files sitting in the subdirectory defined
%   by the configuration variable \MacroNI{WEB\_ROOT\_DIR}.
%   In addition, web commands are considered a READ command,
%   so the client will be checked by host-based security.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_ENABLE\_SOAP\_SSL}]
%   \label{param:SubsysEnableSoapSSL}
%   A boolean value that defaults to \Expr{False}.
%   When \Expr{True}, enables SOAP over SSL for the specified
%   \MacroNI{SUBSYS}.
%   Any specific \MacroNI{SUBSYS\_ENABLE\_SOAP\_SSL} setting overrides
%   the value of \MacroNI{ENABLE\_SOAP\_SSL}.
% 
% \item[\Macro{ENABLE\_SOAP\_SSL}]
%   \label{param:EnableSoapSSL}
%   A boolean value that defaults to \Expr{False}.
%   When \Expr{True}, enables SOAP over SSL for all daemons.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_PORT}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLPort}
%   A required port number on which SOAP over SSL messages are
%   accepted, when SOAP over SSL is enabled.
%   The \MacroNI{SUBSYS} must be specified, because multiple daemons
%   running on a single machine may not share a port.
%   There is no default value.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_SERVER\_KEYFILE}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLServerKeyfile}
%   A required complete path and file name to specify the daemon's
%   identity, as used in authentication when SOAP over SSL is enabled.
%   The file is to be  an OpenSSL PEM file containing a certificate
%   and private key.
%   There is no default value.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_SERVER\_KEYFILE\_PASSWORD}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLServerKeyfilePassword}
%   An optional complete path and file name to specify
%   a password for unlocking the daemon's private key.
%   There is no default value.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_CA\_FILE}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLCaFile}
%   A required complete path and file name to specify 
%   a file containing certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
%   Only clients who present a certificate signed by a trusted
%   CA will be authenticated.
%   There is no default value.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_CA\_DIR}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLCaDir}
%   A required complete path to a directory
%   containing certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
%   Only clients who present a certificate signed by a trusted
%   CA will be authenticated.
%   There is no default value.
% 
% \item[\Macro{SUBSYS\_SOAP\_SSL\_DH\_FILE}]
%   \label{param:SubsysSoapSSLDhFile}
%   An optional complete path and file name to a DH file
%   containing keys for a DH key exchange.
%   There is no default value.

\subsection{\label{sec:Credd-Config-File-Entries}
\condor{credd} Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{CRED\_SUPER\_USERS}]
\label{param:CreddSuperUsers}   Access to a stored credential is
restricted to the user who submitted the credential, and any user
names specified in this macro.  The format is a space or comma
separated list of user names which are valid on the \Condor{credd}
host.
The default value of this macro is \Expr{root} on Unix systems, and
\Expr{Administrator} on Windows systems.

\item[\Macro{CRED\_STORE\_DIR}]
\label{param:CredStoreDir}   Directory for storing credentials.  This
directory must exist prior to starting \Condor{credd}.  It is highly
recommended to restrict access permissions to \emph{only} the
directory owner.
The default value is
\Expr{\$(SPOOL\_DIR)/cred}.

\item[\Macro{CRED\_INDEX\_FILE}]
\label{param:CredIndexFile}   Index file path of saved credentials.
This file will be automatically created if it does not exist.
The default value is
\Expr{\$(CRED\_STORE\_DIR)/cred-index}.

\item[\Macro{DEFAULT\_CRED\_EXPIRE\_THRESHOLD}]
\label{param:DefaultCredExpireThreshold}  \Condor{credd} will attempt
to refresh credentials when their remaining lifespan is less than this
value.
Units = seconds.  Default value = 3600 seconds (1 hour).

\item[\Macro{CRED\_CHECK\_INTERVAL}]
\label{param:CredCheckInterval} \Condor{credd} periodically checks
remaining lifespan of stored credentials, at this interval.
Units = seconds.  Default value = 60 seconds (1 minute).

\subsection{\label{sec:Stork-Config-File-Entries}
Stork Configuration File Macros}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
\begin{description}

\item[\Macro{STORK\_MAX\_NUM\_JOBS}]
\label{param:StorkMaxNumJobs}
Limits the number of concurrent data placements handled by Stork.
Default value = 10.

\item[\Macro{STORK\_MAX\_RETRY}]
\label{param:StorkMaxRetry}
Limits the number attempts for a data placement.  For data transfers,
this includes transfer attempts on the primary protocol and all
alternate protocols, and all retries.
Default value = 10.

\item[\Macro{STORK\_MAXDELAY\_INMINUTES}]
\label{param:StorkMaxDelayInMinutes}
Limits the run time for a data placement job, after which the
placement is considered failed.
Units = minutes, default value = 10, minimum value = 1.

\item[\Macro{STORK\_TMP\_CRED\_DIR}]
\label{param:StorkTmpCredDir}
Temporary credential storage directory used by Stork.
Default value = \File{/tmp}.

\item[\Macro{STORK\_MODULE\_DIR}]
\label{param:StorkModuleDir}
Directory containing Stork modules.  If not defined, the value for the
\Macro{LIBEXEC} macro is used.  It is a fatal error for
both of these macros to be undefined.
