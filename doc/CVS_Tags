** branch to another should be listed here.  Also, anytime we make a
** new branch that includes the doc directory, we should make a note
** of that here.  (New tags should be added at the top of the file,

06/09/03 V6_4-doc-merge-2 
    the state of the V6_4-branch before merging into V6_5-branch. 
    This is to pick up the new chapter on platform-specific info. 

04/07/03 V6_5-doc-pre-merge-V6_5_0-doc-merge-1
	The state of the doc directory in V6_5-branch just before merging
	from V6_5_0-branch as tagged at V6_5_0-doc-merge-1.

04/07/03 V6_5-doc-post-merge-V6_5_0-doc-merge-1
	The state of the doc directory in V6_5-branch just before merging
	from V6_5_0-branch as tagged at V6_5_0-doc-merge-1.

04/07/03 V6_5_0-doc-merge-1
	The state of the doc directory in V6_5_0-branch before merging it
	into the V6_5-branch.  This is the second merge of doc from the
	V6_5_0-branch to the V6_5-branch.  The first one was done as
	tagged at V6_5_0-merge-1, before we started merging the doc
	separately.

03/19/03 V6_5_0-doc-post-merge-V6_4-doc-merge-1
    The state of the doc directory of the V6_5_0-branch after the
    merge of V6_4-branch as tagged V6_4-doc-merge-1

03/19/03 V6_5_0-doc-pre-merge-V6_4-doc-merge-1
    The state of the doc directory of the V6_5_0-branch before the
    merge of V6_4-branch as tagged V6_4-doc-merge-1

03/18/03 V6_4-doc-merge-1
    the state of the V6_4-branch before merging into V6_5_0-branch
    (again).  This is first time we're doing this for the docs
    separately.  The previous merge that did both source and
    docs was the V6_4-merge-7.
    
03/07/03 V6_4-merge-7
    the state of the V6_4-branch before merging into V6_5_0-branch
    (again).  this includes a few minor but important bug fixes that
    have gone into V6_4-branch that need to be present before we ship
    6.5.0.  [NOTE: this was the last time doc was merged from
    V6_4-branch to V6_5_0-branch with the rest of the source.  So, the
    next time we merge doc from V6_4-branch to V6_5_0-branch,
    "V6_4-merge-7" would be the "last-merged-from" tag, in the
    HOWTO-merge instructions.]

02/07/03 V6_5_0-merge-1
    The state of the V6_5_0-branch before merging back into
    V6_5-branch. It has a few bug fixes, and some changes from V6_4 on
    it.  This is the first time V6_5_0 has ever been merged into V6_5.
    [NOTE: this was the last time doc was merged from V6_5_0-branch to
    the V6_5-branch with the rest of the source.    So, the
    next time we merge doc from V6_5_0-branch -> V6_5-branch,
    "V6_5_0-merge-1" would be the "last-merged-from" tag, in the
    HOWTO-merge instructions.]

02/04/03 V6_5_0-branch
    A stable branch for the V6.5.0 release. It's off the V6_5-branch.

07/19/02 V6_5-branch
    The V6_5 development series branch.  For important,
    low-hanging new features.  We should try to keep this branch
    so it's always ready to be released within a week, if needed.
    This development series should only last for a month of
    development, and then be hardened for another stable release.
    as soon as the trunk (new classads) porting is done in the
    most basic level, and daemons with new classads can run jobs
    and pass the test suite, we will freeze development in 6_5,
    have a few people work to make it stable, and finally move all
    development into new classads.  yee haw!

07/19/02 V6_4-branch
    The V6_4 *stable* series branch.  ONLY BUG FIXES to 6.4.1!
