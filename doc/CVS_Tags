** the doc directory.  So, any tags related to merging doc from one
** branch to another should be listed here.  Also, anytime we make a
** new branch that includes the doc directory, we should make a note
** of that here.  (New tags should be added at the top of the file,
** just after this header).  Thanks!  Derek Wright, 3/17/03

    V6_4-branch to V6_5_0-branch with the rest of the source.  So, the
    next time we merge doc from V6_4-branch to V6_5_0-branch,

    HOWTO-merge instructions.]

    "V6_5_0-merge-1" would be the "last-merged-from" tag, in the
    HOWTO-merge instructions.]

07/19/02 V6_5-branch
    The V6_5 development series branch.  For important,
    low-hanging new features.  We should try to keep this branch
    so it's always ready to be released within a week, if needed.
    This development series should only last for a month of
    development, and then be hardened for another stable release.
    as soon as the trunk (new classads) porting is done in the
    most basic level, and daemons with new classads can run jobs
    and pass the test suite, we will freeze development in 6_5,
    have a few people work to make it stable, and finally move all
    development into new classads.  yee haw!

07/19/02 V6_4-branch
    The V6_4 *stable* series branch.  ONLY BUG FIXES to 6.4.1!
